	abstract = {We propose a framework for understanding and interpreting the pathophysiology of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) that considers wider determinants of health and long-term temporal variation in pathophysiological features and disease phenotype throughout the natural history of the disease. As in other chronic diseases, ME/CFS evolves through different stages, from asymptomatic predisposition, progressing to a prodromal stage, and then to symptomatic disease. Disease incidence depends on genetic makeup and environment factors, the exposure to singular or repeated insults, and the nature of the host response. In people who develop ME/CFS, normal homeostatic processes in response to adverse insults may be replaced by aberrant responses leading to dysfunctional states. Thus, the predominantly neuro-immune manifestations, underlined by a hyper-metabolic state, that characterize early disease, may be followed by various processes leading to multi-systemic abnormalities and related symptoms. This abnormal state and the effects of a range of mediators such as products of oxidative and nitrosamine stress, may lead to progressive cell and metabolic dysfunction culminating in a hypometabolic state with low energy production. These processes do not seem to happen uniformly; although a spiraling of progressive inter-related and self-sustaining abnormalities may ensue, reversion to states of milder abnormalities is possible if the host is able to restate responses to improve homeostatic equilibrium. With time variation in disease presentation, no single ME/CFS case description, set of diagnostic criteria, or molecular feature is currently representative of all patients at different disease stages. While acknowledging its limitations due to the incomplete research evidence, we suggest the proposed framework may support future research design and health care interventions for people with ME/CFS.},

	abstract = {The etiology of myalgic encephalomyelitis also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS has not been established. Controversies exist over whether it is an organic disease or a psychological disorder and even the existence of ME/CFS as a disease entity is sometimes denied. Suggested causal hypotheses have included psychosomatic disorders, infectious agents, immune dysfunctions, autoimmunity, metabolic disturbances, toxins and inherited genetic factors. Clinical, immunological and epidemiological evidence supports the hypothesis that: ME/CFS is an infectious disease; the causal pathogen persists in patients; the pathogen can be transmitted by casual contact; host factors determine susceptibility to the illness; and there is a population of healthy carriers, who may be able to shed the pathogen. ME/CFS is endemic globally as sporadic cases and occasional cluster outbreaks (epidemics). Cluster outbreaks imply an infectious agent. An abrupt flu-like onset resembling an infectious illness occurs in outbreak patients and many sporadic patients. Immune responses in sporadic patients resemble immune responses in other infectious diseases. Contagion is shown by finding secondary cases in outbreaks, and suggested by a higher prevalence of ME/CFS in sporadic patients' genetically unrelated close contacts (spouses/partners) than the community. Abortive cases, sub-clinical cases, and carrier state individuals were found in outbreaks. The chronic phase of ME/CFS does not appear to be particularly infective. Some healthy patient-contacts show immune responses similar to patients' immune responses, suggesting exposure to the same antigen (a pathogen). The chronicity of symptoms and of immune system changes and the occurrence of secondary cases suggest persistence of a causal pathogen. Risk factors which predispose to developing ME/CFS are: a close family member with ME/CFS; inherited genetic factors; female gender; age; rest/activity; previous exposure to stress or toxins; various infectious diseases preceding the onset of ME/CFS; and occupational exposure of health care professionals. The hypothesis implies that ME/CFS patients should not donate blood or tissue and usual precautions should be taken when handling patients' blood and tissue. No known pathogen has been shown to cause ME/CFS. Confirmation of the hypothesis requires identification of a causal pathogen. Research should focus on a search for unknown and known pathogens. Finding a causal pathogen could assist with diagnosis; help find a biomarker; enable the development of anti-microbial treatments; suggest preventive measures; explain pathophysiological findings; and reassure patients about the validity of their symptoms.},

	abstract = {The potential benefits of the scientific insights gleaned from years of treating ME/CFS for the emerging symptoms of COVID-19, and in particular Longhaul- or Longhauler-COVID-19 are discussed in this opinion article. Longhaul COVID-19 is the current name being given to the long-term sequelae (symptoms lasting beyond 6 weeks) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multiple case definitions for ME/CFS exist, but post-exertional malaise (PEM) is currently emerging as the ‘hallmark’ symptom. The inability to identify a unique trigger of ME/CFS, as well as the inability to identify a specific, diagnostic laboratory test, led many physicians to conclude that the illness was psychosomatic or non-existent. However, recent research in the US and the UK, championed by patient organizations and their use of the internet and social media, suggest underlying pathophysiologies, e.g., oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The similarity and overlap of ME/CFS and Longhaul COVID-19 symptoms suggest to us similar pathological processes. We put forward a unifying hypothesis that explains the precipitating events such as viral triggers and other documented exposures: For their overlap in symptoms, ME/CFS and Longhaul COVID-19 should be described as Post Active Phase of Infection Syndromes (PAPIS). We further propose that the underlying biochemical pathways and pathophysiological processes of similar symptoms are similar regardless of the initiating trigger. Exploration of the biochemical pathways and pathophysiological processes should yield effective therapies for these conditions and others that may exhibit these symptoms. ME/CFS patients have suffered far too long. Longhaul COVD-19 patients should not be subject to a similar fate. We caution that failure to meet the now combined challenges of ME/CFS and Longhaul COVID-19 will impose serious socioeconomic as well as clinical consequences for patients, the families of patients, and society as a whole.},

However, immune dysregulation with impaired NK cell dysfunction and tendency to novel autoimmunity have been frequently reported.

The unpredictable nature of seemingly unconnected and diverse symptoms that are poorly responsive to several allopathic and alternative therapies then contributes to an escalation of the illness with secondary dysfunction of multiple other systems.

	abstract = {Background:
              Little emphasis has been given to the fact that various psychological processes and behaviors in chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) have neural correlates that affect—and are affected by—the immune system. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the literature on cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between psychological and immunological variables/changes in CFS/ME.
            
            
              Methods:
              The systematic literature search was conducted on Dec 10, 2020 using PubMed. Original research studies investigating associations between a predefined set of psychological and immunological variables in CFS/ME were included. Specifically, the review was focused on studies examining the following psychological variables: executive function, emotion regulation, interpersonal function, sleep, mental health, anxiety, depression, and/or other psychiatric symptoms. In terms of immunological variables, studies investigating interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), CD4
              +
              , and/or CD8
              +
              were included. Besides original research papers, other potentially relevant papers (e.g., literature reviews) were carefully read and reference lists were checked in order to identify any additional relevant studies. Available data was summarized in text and tables.
            
            
              Results:
              The literature search identified 897 potentially relevant papers. Ultimately, 14 studies (807 participants in total) were included in the review of which only two were longitudinal in nature. The review indicated that executive function is associated with IL-1 and IL-6, and interpersonal function is associated with IL-6 and TNF-α. Further, the available data suggested that emotion regulation is associated with IL-2 and sleep is associated with IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-2. Interestingly, poorer emotion regulation, interpersonal function, and sleep have all been found to be associated with higher cytokine levels. Executive function has shown both positive and negative relationships with cytokines and among these psychological constructs, it is also the only one that has been found to be associated with CD4
              +
              and CD8
              +
              counts/percentages.
            
            
              Conclusions:

              Background
              Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease with unknown causes. From the perspectives on the etiology and pathophysiology, ME/CFS has been labeled differently, which influenced changes in case definitions and terminologies. This review sought to feature aspects of the history, developments, and differential symptoms in the case definitions.
            
            
              Methods
              A search was conducted through PubMed published to February 2020 using the following search keywords: case definition AND chronic fatigue syndrome [MeSH Terms]. All reference lists of the included studies were checked. Of the included studies, the number of citations and the visibility in the literatures of the definitions were considered for comparisons of the criteria.
            
            
              Results
              Since the first 'ME' case definition was developed in 1986, 25 case definitions/diagnostic criteria were created based on three conceptual factors (etiology, pathophysiology, and exclusionary disorders). These factors can be categorized into four categories (ME, ME/CFS, CFS, and SEID) and broadly characterized according to primary disorder (ME-viral, CFS-unknown, ME/CFS-inflammatory, SEID-multisystemic), compulsory symptoms (ME and ME/CFS-neuroinflammatory, CFS and SEID-fatigue and/or malaise), and required conditions (ME-infective agent, ME/CFS, CFS, SEID-symptoms associated with fatigue, e.g., duration of illness). ME and ME/CFS widely cover all symptom categories, while CFS mainly covers neurologic and neurocognitive symptoms. Fatigue, cognitive impairment, PEM, sleep disorder, and orthostatic intolerance were the overlapping symptoms of the 4 categories, which were included as SEID criteria.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study comprehensively described the journey of the development of case definitions and compared the symptom criteria. This review provides broader insights and explanations to understand the complexity of ME/CFS for clinicians and researchers.},

This presumption derived from the fact that some patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome have very high or very low titers of certain antibodies to EBV. A review of seroepidemiologic patterns of response to EBV and of studies of patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome shows that these antibody titers overlap considerably both with those of controls or other healthy persons and with those of patients with other illnesses. Given the high prevalence of exposure to EBV, it would be difficult to determine whether the virus caused the syndrome or whether the antibody elevations resulted from the illness, even if distinct differences in titers existed. Other methodologic issues of control selection, laboratory test comparability, and differing case definitions pose problems in studying this syndrome. The recently published working case definition should facilitate the continuing search for causes.},

	abstract = {Millions globally suffer from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The inflammatory symptoms, illness onset, recorded outbreak events, and physiological variations provide strong indications that ME/CFS, at least sometimes, has an infectious origin, possibly resulting in a chronic unidentified viral infection. Meanwhile, studies exposing generalized metabolic disruptions in ME/CFS have stimulated interest in isolated immune cells with an altered metabolic state. As the metabolism dictates the cellular function, dissecting the biomechanics of dysfunctional immune cells in ME/CFS can uncover states such as exhaustion, senescence, or anergy, providing insights into the consequences of these phenotypes in this disease. Despite the similarities that are seen metabolically between ME/CFS and other chronic viral infections that result in an exhausted immune cell state, immune cell exhaustion has not yet been verified in ME/CFS. This review explores the evidence for immunometabolic dysfunction in ME/CFS T cell and natural killer (NK) cell populations, comparing ME/CFS metabolic and functional features to dysfunctional immune cell states, and positing whether anergy, exhaustion, or senescence could be occurring in distinct immune cell populations in ME/CFS, which is consistent with the hypothesis that ME/CFS is a chronic viral disease. This comprehensive review of the ME/CFS immunometabolic literature identifies CD8+ T cell exhaustion as a probable contender, underscores the need for further investigation into the dysfunctional state of CD4+ T cells and NK cells, and explores the functional implications of molecular findings in these immune-cell types. Comprehending the cause and impact of ME/CFS immune cell dysfunction is critical to understanding the physiological mechanisms of ME/CFS, and developing effective treatments to alleviate the burden of this disabling condition.},

	abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) affects approximately 1\% of the general population. It is a chronic, disabling, multi-system disease for which there is no effective treatment. This is probably related to the limited knowledge about its origin. Here, we summarized the current knowledge about the pathogenesis of ME/CFS and revisit the immunopathobiology of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Given the similarities between EBV-associated autoimmune diseases and cancer in terms of poor T cell surveillance of cells with EBV latency, expanded EBV-infected cells in peripheral blood and increased antibodies against EBV, we hypothesize that there could be a common etiology generated by cells with EBV latency that escape immune surveillance. Albeit inconclusive, multiple studies in patients with ME/CFS have suggested an altered cellular immunity and augmented Th2 response that could result from mechanisms of evasion to some pathogens such as EBV, which has been identified as a risk factor in a subset of ME/CFS patients. Namely, cells with latency may evade the immune system in individuals with genetic predisposition to develop ME/CFS and in consequence, there could be poor CD4 T cell immunity to mitogens and other specific antigens, as it has been described in some individuals. Ultimately, we hypothesize that within ME/CFS there is a subgroup of patients with DRB1 and DQB1 alleles that could confer greater susceptibility to EBV, where immune evasion mechanisms generated by cells with latency induce immunodeficiency. Accordingly, we propose new endeavors to investigate if anti-EBV therapies could be effective in selected ME/CFS patients.},

There are several reports confirming the association between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infection and CFS illness. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to integrate the information of published studies with regard to this association until May 2021. Methods: The literature search was based on keywords including “chronic fatigue syndrome and HHV 6,” “chronic fatigue syndrome and HHV-6,” “chronic fatigue syndrome and HHV6,” “chronic fatigue syndrome and Herpes virus 6,” and “chronic fatigue syndrome and Herpesvirus6” in MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science, and EMBASE. Results: The literature search identified 17 studies to be included in the systematic review and 11 studies in meta-analysis. The symmetry funnel plot and Egger’s test (p value = 0.2) identified no publication bias among studies. Moreover, the low level of I2 revealed homogeneity across studies. Discussion: In conclusion, the association between the HHV-6 infection and CFS incidence was substantiated. However, the results of this study also suggest that further comprehensive studies are needed to solidify the association between HHV-6 and CFS. Future studies should consider additional factors that may have affected the significance of such a correlation.},

CFS patients had a high prevalence (51\%) of one of four Mycoplasma species (OR = 13.8, 95\%CL 5.8–32.9, P {\textgreater}0.001) and often showed evidence of co-infections with different Mycoplasma species, Chlamydia pneumoniae (OR = 8.6,95\%CL 1.0–71.1, P {\textgreater}0.01) and/or active Human Herpes Virus-6 (HHV-6) (OR = 4.5,95\%CL 2.0–10.2, P {\textgreater}0.001). We found that 8\% of the CFS patients showed evidence of C. pneumoniae and 31\% of active HHV-6 infections. Since the presence of one or more chronic systemic infections may predispose patients to other infections, we examined the prevalence of C. pneumoniae and active HHV-6 infections in mycoplasma-positive and -negative patients. The incidence of C. pneumoniae or HHV-6 was similar in mycoplasma-positive and -negative patients, suggesting that such infections occur independently in CFS patients. Also, the incidence of C. pneumoniae in active HHV-6-positive and -negative patients was similar. Control subjects (N = 100) had low rates of mycoplasma (6\%), active HHV-6 (9\%) or chlamydia (1\%) infections, and there were no co-infections in control subjects. Differences in bacterial and/or viral infections in CFS patients compared to control subjects were significant.

The validated Energy Index (EI) point score assessing physical functional capacity, Holter monitor, multigated (radionuclide) MUGA rest/stress ventriculographic examination, EBV serum IgM viral capsid antibodies (VCA), and EBV early antigen diffuse (EA) were followed. After six-months, Group 1 CFS patients receiving valacyclovir experienced an increased mean least square EI point score +1.12 units (122 kcal/day), while the placebo cohort increased +0.42 EI units (65 kcal/day). EI point scores at Group 2 increased progressively. Sinus tachycardias decreased and abnormal cardiac wall motion improved. Serum antibody titers to EBV VCA IgM decreased.

	abstract = {There is no known treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Little is known about its pathogenesis. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) have been proposed as infectious triggers. Thirty CFS patients with elevated IgG antibody titers against HHV-6 and EBV were randomized 2:1 to receive valganciclovir (VGCV) or placebo for 6 months in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical endpoints aimed at measuring physical and mental fatigue included the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) scores, self-reported cognitive function, and physician-determined responder status. Biological endpoints included monocyte and neutrophil counts and cytokine levels. VGCV patients experienced a greater improvement by MFI-20 at 9 months from baseline compared to placebo patients but this difference was not statistically significant. However, statistically significant differences in trajectories between groups were observed in MFI-20 mental fatigue subscore (P = 0.039), FSS score (P = 0.006), and cognitive function (P = 0.025). VGCV patients experienced these improvements within the first 3 months and maintained that benefit over the remaining 9 months. Patients in the VGCV arm were 7.4 times more likely to be classified as responders (P = 0.029). In the VGCV arm, monocyte counts decreased (P {\textless} 0.001), neutrophil counts increased (P = 0.037) and cytokines were more likely to evolve towards a Th1-profile (P {\textless} 0.001). Viral IgG antibody titers did not differ between arms. VGCV may have clinical benefit in a subset of CFS patients independent of placebo effect, possibly mediated by immunomodulation and/or antiviral effect.

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Long COVID defines a series of chronic symptoms that patients may experience after resolution of acute COVID-19. Early reports from studies with patients with long COVID suggests a constellation of symptoms with similarities to another chronic medical illness—myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A review study comparing and contrasting ME/CFS with reported symptoms of long COVID may yield mutualistic insight into the characterization and management of both conditions. Materials and Methods: A systemic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycInfo through to 31 January 2021 for studies related to long COVID symptomatology. The literature search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA methodology. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Long COVID symptoms reported by the included studies were compared to a list of ME/CFS symptoms compiled from multiple case definitions. Twenty-five out of 29 known ME/CFS symptoms were reported by at least one selected long COVID study. Conclusions: Early studies into long COVID symptomatology suggest many overlaps with clinical presentation of ME/CFS. The need for monitoring and treatment for patients post-COVID is evident. Advancements and standardization of long COVID research methodologies would improve the quality of future research, and may allow further investigations into the similarities and differences between long COVID and ME/CFS.},

Exhaustion develops in a step-wise and progressive manner, ranges in severity, and can culminate in the deletion of the anti-viral T cells. This disarming of the response is consequential as it compromises viral control and potentially serves to dampen immune-mediated damage. Exhausted T cells are unable to elaborate typical anti-viral effector functions. They are characterized by the sustained upregulation of inhibitory receptors and display a gene expression profile that distinguishes them from prototypic effector and memory T cell populations. In this review we discuss the properties of exhausted T cells; the virological and immunological conditions that favor their development; the cellular and molecular signals that sustain the exhausted state; and strategies for preventing and reversing exhaustion to favor viral control.},

A significant percentage of ME/CFS patients remain undiagnosed, mainly due to the complexity of the disease and the lack of reliable objective biomarkers. ME/CFS patients display decreased metabolism and the severity of symptoms appears to be directly correlated to the degree of metabolic reduction that may be unique to each individual patient. However, the precise pathogenesis is still unknown, preventing the development of effective treatments. The ME/CFS phenotype has been associated with abnormalities in energy metabolism, which are apparently due to mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of mitochondrial diseases, resulting in reduced oxidative metabolism. Such mitochondria may be further contributing to the ME/CFS symptomatology by extracellular secretion of mitochondrial DNA, which could act as an innate pathogen and create an autoinflammatory state in the hypothalamus. We propose that stimulation of hypothalamic mast cells by environmental, neuroimmune, pathogenic and stress triggers activates microglia, leading to focal inflammation in the brain and disturbed homeostasis. This process could be targeted for the development of novel effective treatments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The authors have previously reported genomic subtypes of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) based on expression of 88 human genes.
AIM: To attempt to reproduce these findings, determine the specificity of this signature to CFS/ME, and test for associations between CFS/ME subtype and infection.
METHODS: Expression levels of 88 human genes were determined in blood of 62 new patients with idiopathic CFS/ME (according to Fukuda criteria), six patients with Q-fever-associated CFS/ME from the Birmingham Q-fever outbreak (according to Fukuda criteria), 14 patients with endogenous depression (according to DSM-IV criteria) and 29 normal blood donors.
RESULTS: In patients with CFS/ME, differential expression was confirmed for all 88 genes. Q-CFS/ME had similar patterns of gene expression to idiopathic CFS/ME. Gene expression in patients with endogenous depression was similar to that in the normal controls, except for upregulation of five genes (APP, CREBBP, GNAS, PDCD2 and PDCD6). Clustering of combined gene data in CFS/ME patients for this and the authors' previous study (117 CFS/ME patients) revealed genomic subtypes with distinct differences in SF36 scores, clinical phenotypes, severity and geographical distribution. Antibody testing for Epstein-Barr virus, enterovirus, Coxiella burnetii and parvovirus B19 revealed evidence of subtype-specific relationships for Epstein-Barr virus and enterovirus, the two most common infectious triggers of CFS/ME.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the involvement of these genes in CFS/ME.},

Methods: This cross-sectional self-report study compared patient groups with long-duration median = 18 years; n = 258 and short-duration median = 3 years; n = 28 CFS to a group of healthy significant others n = 79 on symptomatic, neurocognitive, and psychological variables. Data were gathered from a 574-item postal questionnaire. Results: A principal-components analysis of CFS symptom data yielded a three-factor solution: cognitive problems; flu-like symptoms; and neurologic symptoms. Compared with the short-duration CFS group, the long-duration group had significantly higher CFS symptom severity scores (p {\textless} 0.04), largely attributable to increased cognitive difficulties. A subgroup comparison of subjects ill for {\textless} 3 years versus those ill 4–7 years suggested that denial coping strategies were more likely in those participants with the shorter illness duration. Significant differences between both CFS groups and healthy controls were found in a number of comorbid disorders. Participants with CFS most often endorsed immune/viral abnormalities and persistent stress as important perceived causes of their illness. Conclusion: Participants with long-duration CFS reported a large number of specific cognitive difficulties that were greater in severity than those reported by participants with short-duration CFS. The pattern of comorbid disorders in the CFS groups was consistent with hypersensitivity and viral reactivation hypotheses.},

	abstract = {The diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), an illness characterized by medically unexplained fatigue, depends on a clinical case definition representing one or more pathophysiological mechanisms. To prepare for studies of these mechanisms, this study sought to identify subtypes of CFS. In 161 women meeting 1994 criteria for CFS, principal components analysis of the 10 ‘minor’ symptoms of CFS produced three factors interpreted to indicate musculoskeletal, infectious and neurological subtypes. Extreme scores on one or more of these factors characterized about 2/3 of the sample. Those characterized by the neurological factor were at increased risk of reduced scores on cognitive tests requiring attention, working memory, long-term memory or rapid performance. In addition, the neurological subtype was associated with reduced levels of function. Those characterized by the musculoskeletal factor were at increased risk for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia (chronic widespread pain and mechanical allodynia) and reduced physical function. Those characterized by the infectious factor were less likely to evidence co-occurring fibromyalgia, and showed lesser risk of functional impairment. The prevalence of disability was increased in those with the highest scores on any of the subtypes, as well as in those with high scores on multiple factors. Depression and anxiety, while frequently present, were not more prevalent in any particular subtype, and did not increase with the severity of specific symptom reports. Results suggest that subtypes of CFS may be identified from reports of the minor diagnostic symptoms, and that these subtypes demonstrate construct validity.},

It documents the symptoms reported, in terms of presence and severity, by 189 young people presenting for assessment of chronic fatigue, and compares them with responses from a matched sample of 68 normal, healthy controls. To estimate the magnitude of the differences between the clinical and control groups on the means of all composite factor scores, a multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was undertaken using STATISTICA. CFS is a condition of unknown etiology, characterized by extreme fatigue exacerbated by minimal physical activity. In addition, symptoms such as difficulty with concentration, headache and sleep disturbance, muscle aches and pains and recurrent sore throat are common. CFS is predominantly an illness of young adults. Although the differentiation of CFS from a somatization disorder has been debated, and the role of psychological factors in “perpetuating” the illness has been discussed, it is generally agreed that patients consistently report the symptom complex and that it does differ from depression and other common fatiguing conditions.},

In this cohort, patients had documented ME/CFS for a mean 13.7 years, whereby half (50.3\%) stated their condition was progressively worsening. Triggering events and times of disease onset were recalled by 90\% of the participants. An infectious disease was associated with a singular or part of multiple events by 72.9\% and 80.6\%, respectively. Prior to disease onset, a third of the patients reported respiratory infections; followed by gastro-intestinal infections (15.4\%) and tick-borne diseases (16.2\%). Viral infections were recalled by 77.8\% of the respondents, with Epstein Barr Virus being the most commonly reported agent. Patients self-reported an average number of 13 different symptoms, all described specific triggers of symptoms exacerbation and 82.2\% suffered from co-morbidities.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by a variety of symptoms including post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive impairment. A variety of case definitions (e.g., the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC), the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis International Consensus Criteria (ME-ICC), and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria) have been used to diagnose patients. However, these case definitions are consensus-based rather than empirical.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the validity of the aforementioned case definitions by factor analyzing a large, international sample (N = 2308) of ME/CFS symptom data. We performed primary and secondary exploratory factor analyses on the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire's 54-item symptom inventory. These results were compared to the CCC, the ME-ICC, and the IOM criteria.
RESULTS: We identified seven symptom domains, including post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, and sleep dysfunction. Contrary to many existing case criteria, our analyses did not identify pain as an independent factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Although our results implicate a factor solution that best supports the CCC, revisions to the criteria are recommended.Implications for rehabilitationME/CFS is a chronic illness with no consensus regarding case diagnostic criteria, which creates difficulty for patients seeking assistance and disability benefits.The current study compared three commonly used case definitions for ME/CFS by factor analyzing symptomological data from an international sample of patients.Our results suggest three primary and four secondary symptom domains which differed from all three case definitions.These findings could help reduce barriers to care for those disabled with ME/CFS by guiding the development of an empirically-based case definition.},

Although enterovirus protein, RNA and non-cytopathic viruses have been demonstrated in the stomach biopsies of patients with myalgia encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), causality for chronic diseases is difficult to establish without having well-documented cases of acute enterovirus infections. The aim of this study was to link acute enteroviral infection to viral persistence in patients with ME/CFS.
Method Patients admitted to the hospital with acute febrile illnesses were screened for enteroviral infections. Acutely infected patients were followed longitudinally, and those who developed symptoms of ME/CFS underwent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and biopsies of the antrum to document viral persistence by immunoperoxidase staining for viral protein and viral RNA assay.
Results Three representative patients with different manifestations of acute enterovirus infections progressed to have chronic symptoms of ME/CFS. Persistent viral infection was demonstrated in the antrum years later.
Conclusion After acute infections, enteroviruses can persist in patients resulting in manifestation of ME/CFS. Chronic enterovirus infection in an immunocompetent host may be an example of a stalemate between attenuated, intracellular viruses and an ineffective immune response.},

Biomedical research has made substantial progress in identifying various pathophysiological changes and risk factors and in characterizing the illness; further, similarities with other viral-onset illnesses such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome have laid the groundwork for research in the field. In this Review, we explore the current literature and highlight key findings, the overlap with other conditions, the variable onset of symptoms, long COVID in children and the impact of vaccinations. Although these key findings are critical to understanding long COVID, current diagnostic and treatment options are insufficient, and clinical trials must be prioritized that address leading hypotheses.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients with COVID-19 experience prolonged symptoms, known as Long COVID. Few systematic studies have investigated this population, particularly in outpatient settings. Hence, relatively little is known about symptom makeup and severity, expected clinical course, impact on daily functioning, and return to baseline health.
METHODS: We conducted an online survey of people with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, distributed via COVID-19 support groups (e.g. Body Politic, Long COVID Support Group, Long Haul COVID Fighters) and social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). Data were collected from September 6, 2020 to November 25, 2020. We analyzed responses from 3762 participants with confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive; 1020) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested; 2742) COVID-19, from 56 countries, with illness lasting over 28 days and onset prior to June 2020. We estimated the prevalence of 203 symptoms in 10 organ systems and traced 66 symptoms over seven months. We measured the impact on life, work, and return to baseline health.
FINDINGS: For the majority of respondents ({\textgreater}91\%), the time to recovery exceeded 35 weeks. During their illness, participants experienced an average of 55.9+/- 25.5 (mean+/-STD) symptoms, across an average of 9.1 organ systems. The most frequent symptoms after month 6 were fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. Symptoms varied in their prevalence over time, and we identified three symptom clusters, each with a characteristic temporal profile. 85.9\% of participants (95\% CI, 84.8\% to 87.0\%) experienced relapses, primarily triggered by exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress. 86.7\% (85.6\% to 92.5\%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7\% (38.5\% to 50.5\%) of recovered respondents. 1700 respondents (45.2\%) required a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness, and an additional 839 (22.3\%) were not working at the time of survey due to illness. Cognitive dysfunction or memory issues were common across all age groups ({\textasciitilde}88\%). Except for loss of smell and taste, the prevalence and trajectory of all symptoms were similar between groups with confirmed and suspected COVID-19.
INTERPRETATION: Patients with Long COVID report prolonged, multisystem involvement and significant disability. By seven months, many patients have not yet recovered (mainly from systemic and neurological/cognitive symptoms), have not returned to previous levels of work, and continue to experience significant symptom burden.
FUNDING: All authors contributed to this work in a voluntary capacity. The cost of survey hosting (on Qualtrics) and publication fee was covered by AA's research grant (Wellcome Trust/Gatsby Charity via Sainsbury Wellcome center, UCL).},

	abstract = {Some patients remain unwell for months after “recovering” from acute COVID-19. They develop persistent fatigue, cognitive problems, headaches, disrupted sleep, myalgias and arthralgias, post-exertional malaise, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms that greatly interfere with their ability to function and that can leave some people housebound and disabled. The illness (Long COVID) is similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) as well as to persisting illnesses that can follow a wide variety of other infectious agents and following major traumatic injury. Together, these illnesses are projected to cost the U.S. trillions of dollars. In this review, we first compare the symptoms of ME/CFS and Long COVID, noting the considerable similarities and the few differences. We then compare in extensive detail the underlying pathophysiology of these two conditions, focusing on abnormalities of the central and autonomic nervous system, lungs, heart, vasculature, immune system, gut microbiome, energy metabolism and redox balance. This comparison highlights how strong the evidence is for each abnormality, in each illness, and helps to set priorities for future investigation. The review provides a current road map to the extensive literature on the underlying biology of both illnesses.},

Most studies have examined these conditions individually without providing evidence on co-occurring conditions. In this study, we leveraged the electronic health record data of two large cohorts, INSIGHT and OneFlorida+, from the national Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. We created a development cohort from INSIGHT and a validation cohort from OneFlorida+ including 20,881 and 13,724 patients, respectively, who were SARS-CoV-2 infected, and we investigated their newly incident diagnoses 30–180 days after a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through machine learning analysis of over 137 symptoms and conditions, we identified four reproducible PASC subphenotypes, dominated by cardiac and renal (including 33.75\% and 25.43\% of the patients in the development and validation cohorts); respiratory, sleep and anxiety (32.75\% and 38.48\%); musculoskeletal and nervous system (23.37\% and 23.35\%); and digestive and respiratory system (10.14\% and 12.74\%) sequelae. These subphenotypes were associated with distinct patient demographics, underlying conditions before SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute infection phase severity. Our study provides insights into the heterogeneity of PASC and may inform stratified decision-making in the management of PASC conditions., Machine learning applied to electronic health records in two US cohorts from the RECOVER initiative identified four Long-COVID subphenotypes that differ in the involvement of organ systems, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and underlying conditions.},

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify a distinct and significant temporal pattern of PASC symptoms (symptom type and onset) among a nationwide sample of PASC survivors (n = 5652). The sample was randomly sorted into two independent samples for exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Five factors emerged from the EFA: (1) cold and flu-like symptoms, (2) change in smell and/or taste, (3) dyspnea and chest pain, (4) cognitive and visual problems, and (5) cardiac symptoms. The CFA had excellent model fit (x2 = 513.721, df = 207, p {\textless} 0.01, TLI = 0.952, CFI = 0.964, RMSEA = 0.024). These findings demonstrate a novel symptom pattern for PASC.

There are no known biomarkers that can distinguish between patients with ME/CFS, although mitochondrial abnormalities are often demonstrated. We sought to assess the prevalence of ME/CFS in limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) patients early in their disease ({\textless}5 years from the onset of non-Raynaud's symptoms) and to determine if alterations in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) transcripts and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity could be used to distinguish between fatigued and non-fatigued patients. All SSc patients met ACR/EULAR classification criteria. ME/CFS-related symptoms were assessed through validated questionnaires, and the expression of ETC transcripts and mtDNA integrity were quantified via qPCR. SSc patients with ME/CFS could be distinguished from non-fatigued patients through ETC gene analysis; specifically, reduced expression of ND4 and CyB and increased expression of Cox7C. ND4 and CyB expression correlated with indicators of disease severity. Further prospective and functional studies are needed to determine if this altered signature can be further utilized to better identify ME/CFS in SSc patients, and whether ME/CFS in early SSc disease could predict more severe disease outcomes.},

	abstract = {Fatigue is a common symptom associated with a wide range of chronic diseases. A large number of instruments have been developed to measure fatigue. An assessment regarding the reliability, validity, and utility of fatigue measures is time-consuming for the clinician and researcher, and few reviews exist on which to draw such information. The aim of this article is to present a critical review of fatigue measures, the populations in which the scales have been used, and the extent to which the psychometric properties of each instrument have been evaluated to provide clinicians and researchers with information on which to base decisions. Seven databases were searched for all articles that measured fatigue and offered an insight into the psychometric properties of the scales used over the period 1980–2007. Criteria for judging the “ideal” measure were developed to encompass scale usability, clinical/research utility, and the robustness of psychometric properties. Twenty-two fatigue measures met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. A further 17 measures met some of the criteria, but have not been tested beyond initial development, and are reviewed briefly at the end of the article. The review did not identify any instrument that met all the criteria of an ideal instrument. However, a small number of short instruments demonstrated good psychometric properties (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS], Fatigue Impact Scale [FIS], and Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI]), and three comprehensive instruments demonstrated the same (Fatigue Symptom Inventory [FSI], Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue [MAF], and Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory [MFSI]). Only four measures (BFI, FSS, FSI, and MAF) demonstrated the ability to detect change over time. The clinician and researcher also should consider the populations in which the scale has been used previously to assess its validity with their own patient group, and assess the content of a scale to ensure that the key qualitative aspects of fatigue of the population of interest are covered.},

	abstract = {First exposure to various human herpesviruses (HHVs) including HHV-6, HCMV and EBV does not cause a life-threatening disease. In fact, most individuals are frequently unaware of their first exposure to such pathogens. These herpesviruses acquire lifelong latency in the human body where they show minimal genomic activity required for their survival. We hypothesized that it is not the latency itself but a timely, regionally restricted viral reactivation in a sub-set of host cells that plays a key role in disease development. HHV-6 (HHV-6A and HHV-6B) and HHV-7 are unique HHVs that acquire latency by integration of the viral genome into sub-telomeric region of human chromosomes. HHV-6 reactivation has been linked to Alzheimer’s Disease, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and many other diseases. However, lack of viral activity in commonly tested biological materials including blood or serum strongly suggests tissue specific localization of active HHV-6 genome. Here in this paper, we attempted to analyze active HHV-6 transcripts in postmortem tissue biopsies from a small cohort of ME/CFS patients and matched controls by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a probe against HHV-6 microRNA (miRNA), miR-aU14. Our results show abundant viral miRNA in various regions of the human brain and associated neuronal tissues including the spinal cord that is only detected in ME/CFS patients and not in controls. Our findings provide evidence of tissue-specific active HHV-6 and EBV infection in ME/CFS, which along with recent work demonstrating a possible relationship between herpesvirus infection and ME/CFS, provide grounds for renewed discussion on the role of herpesviruses in ME/CFS.},

	abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are two complex and multifactorial diseases whose patients experience persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment, among other shared symptoms. The onset of these diseases has also been linked to acute herpesvirus infections or their reactivations. In this work, we re-analyzed a previously-described dataset related to IgG antibody responses to 6 herpesviruses (CMV – cytomegalovirus; EBV – Epstein-Barr virus; HHV6 – human herpesvirus-6; HSV1 and HSV2 – herpes simplex virus-1 and -2, respectively; VZV – varicella-zoster virus) from the United Kingdom ME/CFS biobank. The primary goal was to report the underlying symptomology and its association with herpesvirus IgG antibodies using data from 4 disease-trigger-based subgroups of ME/CFS patients (n = 222) and patients with MS (n = 46). The secondary objective was to assess whether serological data could distinguish ME/CFS and its subgroup from MS using a SuperLearner (SL) algorithm. There was evidence for a significant negative association between temporary eye insight disturbance and CMV antibody concentrations and for a significant positive association between bladder problems and EBV antibody concentrations in the MS group. In the ME/CFS or its subgroups, the most significant antibody-symptom association was obtained for increasing HSV1 antibody concentration and brain fog, a finding in line with a negative impact of HSV1 exposure on cognitive outcomes in both healthy and disease conditions. There was also evidence for a higher number of significant antibody-symptom associations in the MS group than in the ME/CFS group. When we combined all the serological data in an SL algorithm, we could distinguish three ME/CFS subgroups (unknown disease trigger, non-infection trigger, and an infection disease trigger confirmed in the lab at the time of the event) from the MS group. However, we could not find the same for the remaining ME/CFS group (related to an unconfirmed infection disease). In conclusion, IgG antibody data explains more the symptomology of MS patients than the one of ME/CFS patients. Given the fluctuating nature of symptoms in ME/CFS patients, the clinical implication of these findings remains to be determined with a longitudinal study. This study is likely to ascertain the robustness of the associations during natural disease course.},

	abstract = {The present review assesses the current state of literature defining integrative autonomic-immune physiological processing, focusing on studies that have employed electrophysiological, pharmacological, molecular biological and central nervous system experimental approaches. Central autonomic neural networks are informed of peripheral immune status via numerous communicating pathways, including neural and non-neural. Cytokines and other immune factors affect the level of activity and responsivity of discharges in sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves innervating diverse targets. Multiple levels of the neuraxis contribute to cytokine-induced changes in efferent parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve outflows, leading to modulation of peripheral immune responses. The functionality of local sympathoimmune interactions depends on the microenvironment created by diverse signaling mechanisms involving integration between sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitters and neuromodulators; specific adrenergic receptors; and the presence or absence of immune cells, cytokines and bacteria. Functional mechanisms contributing to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway likely involve novel cholinergic-adrenergic interactions at peripheral sites, including autonomic ganglion and lymphoid targets. Immune cells express adrenergic and nicotinic receptors. Neurotransmitters released by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve endings bind to their respective receptors located on the surface of immune cells and initiate immune-modulatory responses. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system are instrumental in orchestrating neuroimmune processes, although additional studies are required to understand dynamic and complex adrenergic-cholinergic interactions. Further understanding of regulatory mechanisms linking the sympathetic nervous, parasympathetic nervous, and immune systems is critical for understanding relationships between chronic disease development and immune-associated changes in autonomic nervous system function.},

	abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) also known as ME/CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) or ME/SEID (Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disorder), is a disabling and often long-lasting disease that can drastically impair quality of life and physical/social functioning of the patients. Underlying pathological mechanisms are to a large extent unknown, but the presence of autoantibodies, cytokine pattern deviations and the presentation of cognitive and autonomic nervous system related symptoms provide evidence for ME being an immunological disorder with elements of autoimmunity. Increased levels of autoantibodies binding to adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in ME-patients have been reported. It is hypothesized that these autoantibodies have pathological significance and contribute to the ME-specific symptoms, however, these observations need to be validated. This study was designed to investigate potential differences in adrenergic and muscarinic receptor autoantibody levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples between ME patients and gender and age-matched healthy controls, and to correlate the autoantibody levels to disease severity. We collected bodyfluids and health-related questionnaires from two Swedish ME cohorts, plasma and CSF from one of the cohorts (n ​= ​24), only plasma from the second cohort (n ​= ​24) together with plasma samples (n ​= ​24) and CSF (n ​= ​6) from healthy controls. All samples were analysed for IgG autoantibodies directed against Alpha- (α1, α2) and Beta- (β1-3) adrenergic receptors and Muscarinic (M) 1–5 acetylcholine receptors using an ELISA technique. The questionnaires were used as measures of disease severity. Significant increases in autoantibody levels in ME patients compared to controls were found for M3 and M4 -receptors in both cohorts and β1, β2, M3 and M4-receptors in one cohort. No significant correlations were found between autoantibody levels and disease severity. No significant levels of autoantibodies were detected in the CSF samples. These findings support previous findings that there exists a general pattern of increased antibody levels to adrenergic and muscarinic receptors within the ME patient group. However, the role of increased adrenergic and muscarinic receptor autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of ME is still uncertain and further research is needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these findings.},

	abstract = {Background
Abnormal immune function is often an underlying component of illness pathophysiology and symptom presentation. Functional and phenotypic immune-related alterations may play a role in the obscure pathomechanism of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). The objective of this study was to investigate the functional ability of innate and adaptive immune cells in moderate and severe CFS/ME patients. The 1994 Fukuda criteria for CFS/ME were used to define CFS/ME patients. CFS/ME participants were grouped based on illness severity with 15 moderately affected (moderate) and 12 severely affected (severe) CFS/ME patients who were age and sex matched with 18 healthy controls. Flow cytometric protocols were used for immunological analysis of dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophil function as well as measures of lytic proteins and T, natural killer (NK) and B cell receptors.

Results
CFS/ME patients exhibited alterations in NK receptors and adhesion markers and receptors on CD4+T and CD8+T cells. Moderate CFS/ME patients had increased CD8+ CD45RA effector memory T cells, SLAM expression on NK cells, KIR2DL5+ on CD4+T cells and BTLA4+ on CD4+T central memory cells. Moderate CFS/ME patients also had reduced CD8+T central memory LFA-1, total CD8+T KLRG1, naïve CD4+T KLRG1 and CD56dimCD16− NK cell CD2+ and CD18+CD2+. Severe CFS/ME patients had increased CD18+CD11c− in the CD56dimCD16− NK cell phenotype and reduced NKp46 in CD56brightCD16dim NK cells.

Conclusions
This research accentuated the presence of immunological abnormalities in CFS/ME and highlighted the importance of assessing functional parameters of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the illness.

	abstract = {CD4+ T cells are commonly divided into regulatory T (Treg) cells and conventional T helper (Th) cells. Th cells control adaptive immunity against pathogens and cancer by activating other effector immune cells. Treg cells are defined as CD4+ T cells in charge of suppressing potentially deleterious activities of Th cells. This review briefly summarizes the current knowledge in the Treg field and defines some key questions that remain to be answered. Suggested functions for Treg cells include: prevention of autoimmune diseases by maintaining self-tolerance; suppression of allergy, asthma and pathogen-induced immunopathology; feto-maternal tolerance; and oral tolerance. Identification of Treg cells remains problematic, because accumulating evidence suggests that all the presently-used Treg markers (CD25, CTLA-4, GITR, LAG-3, CD127 and Foxp3) represent general T-cell activation markers, rather than being truly Treg-specific. Treg-cell activation is antigen-specific, which implies that suppressive activities of Treg cells are antigen-dependent. It has been proposed that Treg cells would be self-reactive, but extensive TCR repertoire analysis suggests that self-reactivity may be the exception rather than the rule. The classification of Treg cells as a separate lineage remains controversial because the ability to suppress is not an exclusive Treg property. Suppressive activities attributed to Treg cells may in reality, at least in some experimental settings, be exerted by conventional Th cell subsets, such as Th1, Th2, Th17 and T follicular (Tfh) cells. Recent reports have also demonstrated that Foxp3+ Treg cells may differentiate in vivo into conventional effector Th cells, with or without concomitant downregulation of Foxp3.},

Besides the assessment of fatigue, impairment and additional complaints such as concentration problems, unrefreshing sleep and deterioration in psychological well-being, those factors were assessed that have been shown to inflate and prolong symptomatology in CFS.

(2) What is the answer?
Homebound patients form a distinct subgroup of CFS patients who might profit from a treatment approach that is tailored to their specific needs.
Homebound patients experienced considerably higher levels of daily fatigue and were considerably less physically active. In fact, two thirds of their daily fatigue scores and half of their Actometer scores showed no overlap with those in the reference group, and all homebound patients were characterised by a pervasively passive activity pattern with an extremely low level of physical activity on almost all days.
Although homebound patients experienced considerably more fatigue and impairment, they did not report more change in symptomatology during the follow-up period than outpatients. In fact, many median change scores were equal to zero.

While attenuated HSV is explored for vaccine, the underlying event remains poorly defined. Here we report that recombinant HSV-1 with a mutation in the γ134.5 protein, a virulence factor, stimulates dendritic cell (DC) maturation which is dependent on TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). When exposed to CD11+ DCs, the mutant virus that lacks the amino terminus of γ134.5 undergoes temporal replication without production of infectious virus. Mechanistically, this leads to sequential phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and p65/RelA. In correlation, DCs up-regulate the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines. However, selective inhibition of TBK1 precludes phosphorylation of IRF3 and subsequent DC activation by the γ134.5 mutant. Herein, the γ134.5 mutant is immune-stimulatory and non-destructive to DCs. Remarkably, upon immunization the γ134.5 mutant induces protection against lethal challenge by the wild type virus, indicative of its vaccine potential. Furthermore, CD11+ DCs primed by the γ134.5 mutant in vivo mediate protection upon adoptive transfer. These results suggest that activation of TBK1 by engineered HSV is crucial for DC maturation, which may contribute to protective immunity.},

HSV infection of DCs induced submaximal maturation, but DCs failed to mature further in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS induced interleukin (IL)–12 secretion, and the induction of primary and secondary T cell responses were impaired by infection. Ultimately, DC infection resulted in delayed, asynchronous apoptotic cell death. However, infected DCs induced HSV recall responses in some individuals. Furthermore, soluble factors secreted by DCs after infection induced DC maturation and primed for IL-12 secretion after LPS stimulation. These data support a pathogenetic model of HSV infection, in which initial delay in the generation of immune responses to HSV at peripheral sites is mediated by disruption of DC function but is overcome by bystander DC maturation and cross-presentation of HSV antigens},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased natural killer (NK) activation has been associated with resistance to HIV-1 infection in several cohorts of HIV-1 exposed, uninfected individuals. Inheritance of protective NK receptor alleles (KIR3DS1 and KIR3DL1) has also been observed in a subset of HIV-1 exposed, uninfected individuals. However, the exact mechanism contributing to NK activation in HIV-1 exposed, uninfected intravenous drug users (EU-IDU) remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of both host genotype and pathogen-induced dendritic cell modulation of NK activation during high-risk activity in a cohort of 15 EU-IDU individuals and 15 control, uninfected donors from Philadelphia.
DESIGN: We assessed the activation status of NK cells and dendritic cells by flow cytometry and utilized functional assays of NK-DC cross-talk to characterize the innate immune compartment in EU-IDU individuals.
RESULTS: As previously reported, NK cell activation (CD69) and/or degranulation (CD107a) was significantly increased in EU-IDU individuals compared with control uninfected donors (P = 0.0056, n = 13). Genotypic analysis indicated that the frequency of protective KIR (KIR3DS1) and HLA-Bw4*80I ligands was not enriched in our cohort of EU-IDU individuals. Rather, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) from EU-IDU exhibited heightened maturation (CD83) compared with control uninfected donors (P = 0.0011, n = 12). When stimulated in vitro, both PDCs and NK cells from EU-IDU individuals maintained strong effector cell function and did not exhibit signs of exhaustion.
CONCLUSION: Increased maturation of PDCs is associated with heightened NK activation in EU-IDU individuals suggesting that both members of the innate compartment may contribute to resistance from HIV-1 infection in EU-IDU.},

Gene microarray data have led to a better understanding of pathogenesis. Recent research has evaluated genetic signatures, described biologic subgroups, and suggested potential targeted treatments. Acute viral infection studies found that initial infection severity was the single best predictor of persistent fatigue. Genomic studies showed that persistent cases express Epstein Barr virus-specific genes and demonstrate abnormalities of mitochondrial function. Studies of immune dysfunction extended observations of natural killer cytotoxic cell dysfunction of the cytotoxic T cell through quantitative evaluation of intracellular perforins and granzymes. Other research has focused on a subgroup of patients with reactivated viral infection. These advances should result in targeted therapies that impact immune function, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation, and persistent viral reactivation.},

Many research groups focus on the role of perforin in various diseases, immune response to bacterial and viral infections, immune surveillance and immunopathology. In addition, perforin is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and allogeneic transplant rejection. Natural killer (NK) cells and CD8-positive T-cells are the main source of perforin. However, CD4-positive T-cells are also able to express a low amount of perforin, when classic cytotoxicity is ineffective or disturbed., Polymerized perforin molecules form channels enabling free, non-selective, passive transport of ions, water, small-molecule substances and enzymes. In consequence, the channels disrupt protective barrier of cell membrane and destroy integrity of the target cell. This review will focus on mechanisms of action and structure of perforin. Also, in this review we discuss the problem of abnormal perforin production in diseases such as: hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), leukemias and lymphomas, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. Better understanding of the role of these molecules in health and disease will open a new field of research with possible therapeutic implications.},

The formation of the immunological synapse between an effector and a target cell leads to exocytic trafficking of the secretory granules and the release of their contents, which include pro-apoptotic serine proteases, granzymes, and pore-forming perforin into the synapse. There, perforin polymerizes and forms a transmembrane pore that allows the delivery of granzymes into the cytosol, where they initiate various apoptotic death pathways. Unlike relatively redundant individual granzymes, functional perforin is absolutely essential for cytotoxic lymphocyte function and immune regulation in the host. Nevertheless, perforin is still the least studied and understood cytotoxic molecule in the immune system. In this review, we discuss the current state of affairs in the perforin field: the protein's structure and function as well as its role in immune-mediated diseases.},

	abstract = {Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterised by disabling fatigue of at least 6 months duration, which is accompanied by various rheumatological, infectious and neuropsychiatric symptoms. A collaborative study group has been formed to deal with the current areas for development in CFS research—namely, to develop an understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CFS, to develop a diagnostic test and to develop specific and curative treatments. Various groups have studied the gene expression in peripheral blood of patients with CFS, and from those studies that have been confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), clearly, the most predominant functional theme is that of immunity and defence. However, we do not yet know the precise gene signature and metabolic pathways involved. Currently, this is being dealt with using a microarray representing 47 000 human genes and variants, massive parallel signature sequencing and real‐time PCR. It will be important to ensure that once a gene signature has been identified, it is specific to CFS and does not occur in other diseases and infections. A diagnostic test is being developed using surface‐enhanced, laser‐desorption and ionisation‐time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry based on a pilot study in which putative biomarkers were identified. Finally, clinical trials are being planned; novel treatments that we believe are important to trial in patients with CFS are interferon‐β and one of the anti‐tumour necrosis factor‐α drugs.},

No link between infections and CFS has been clearly established but the immune system is activated, there are aberrations in several hypothalamic-pituitary axes and involvement of other parts of the central nervous system. No specific treatment has been found. Cognitive behavioural therapy is established to be of value to improve quality of life.

Owing to their early production of cytokines and chemokines, and ability to lyse target cells without prior sensitization, NK cells are crucial components of the innate immune system. Human NK cells can be divided into two subsets based on their cell-surface density of CD56 – CD56bright and CD56dim – each with distinct phenotypic properties. Now, there is ample evidence to suggest that these NK-cell subsets have unique functional attributes and, therefore, distinct roles in the human immune response. The CD56dim NK-cell subset is more naturally cytotoxic and expresses higher levels of Ig-like NK receptors and FCγ receptor III (CD16) than the CD56bright NK-cell subset. By contrast, the CD56bright subset has the capacity to produce abundant cytokines following activation of monocytes, but has low natural cytotoxicity and is CD16dim or CD16−. In addition, we will discuss other cell-surface receptors expressed differentially by human NK-cell subsets and the distinct functional properties of these subsets.},

The basic pre-assumption of the IOM committee for the development of evidence-based diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS was that ME and CFS denote conditions with similar symptoms, hence ME/CFS. The IOM committee recommends: (1) that ME/CFS will be renamed 'systemic exertion intolerance disease' (SEID); and that a new code should be assigned to SEID in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), replacing the existing codes for ME (a neurological disease: G93.3) and CFS ('signs, symptoms, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified': R53.82); (2) that a diagnosis of SEID should be made if the new diagnostic criteria are met; (3) that the Department of Health and Human Services develops a toolkit appropriate for screening and diagnosing patients; and (4) that a multidisciplinary group re-examines the new diagnostic criteria when necessary. This editorial reviews the working procedure of the IOM and two of the outcomes: the recommendation to introduce a new clinical entity (SEID) and new diagnostic criteria. Based upon the contents of the report, and the arguments of the IOM, a search of PubMed and the archive of the Journal of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome using the search terms ME (and old synonyms) and CFS, and a search of PubMed related to the five core symptoms of SEID was conducted. Reviewing the working method and the recommendations, it is concluded that the new diagnostic criteria for SEID are based upon important methodological shortcomings and that the introduction of SEID to replace both ME and CFS has several profound negative consequences outweighing the advantages.},

	abstract = {This review was written from the viewpoint of the treating clinician to educate health care professionals and the public about Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It includes: the clinical definition of ME/CFS with emphasis on how to diagnose ME/CFS; the etiology, pathophysiology, management approach, long-term prognosis and economic cost of ME/CFS. After reading this review, you will be better able to diagnose and treat your patients with ME/CFS using the tools and information provided. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, chronic medical condition characterized by symptom clusters that include: pathological fatigue and malaise that is worse after exertion, cognitive dysfunction, immune dysfunction, unrefreshing sleep, pain, autonomic dysfunction, neuroendocrine and immune symptoms. ME/CFS is common, often severely disabling and costly. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed the ME/CFS literature and estimates that between 836,000 and 2.5 million Americans have ME/CFS at a cost of between 17 and 24 billion dollars annually in the US. The IOM suggested a new name for ME/CFS and called it Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID). SEID's diagnostic criteria are less specific and do not exclude psychiatric disorders in the criteria. The 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey discovered that 29\% of patients with ME/CFS had unmet health care needs and 20\% had food insecurity--lack of access to sufficient healthy foods. ME/CFS can be severely disabling and cause patients to be bedridden. Yet most patients (80\%) struggle to get a diagnosis because doctors have not been taught how to diagnose or treat ME/CFS in medical schools or in their post-graduate educational training. Consequently, the patients with ME/CFS suffer. They are not diagnosed with ME/CFS and are not treated accordingly. Instead of compassionate care from their doctors, they are often ridiculed by the very people from whom they seek help. The precise etiology of ME/CFS remains unknown, but recent advances and research discoveries are beginning to shed light on the enigma of this disease including the following contributors: infectious, genetic, immune, cognitive including sleep, metabolic and biochemical abnormalities. Management of patients with ME/CFS is supportive symptomatic treatment with a patient centered care approach that begins with the symptoms that are most troublesome for the patient. Pacing of activities with strategic rest periods is, in our opinion, the most important coping strategy patients can learn to better manage their illness and stop their post-exertional fatigue and malaise. Pacing allows patients to regain the ability to plan activities and begin to make slow incremental improvements in functionality.},

Moderation on fatigue severity (Checklist Individual Strength, subscale fatigue severity), functional impairment (Sickness Impact Profile-8) and physical functioning (Short Form-36, subscale physical functioning) was investigated using linear mixed model analyses and interaction tests. PROSPERO (CRD42022358245). Data from eight trials (n = 1298 patients) were pooled. CBT showed beneficial effects on fatigue severity (β = −11.46, 95\% CI −15.13 to −7.79); p {\textless} 0.001, functional impairment (β = −448.40, 95\% CI −625.58 to −271.23); p {\textless} 0.001; and physical functioning (β = 9.64, 95\% CI 3.30 to 15.98); p {\textless} 0.001. The effect of CBT on fatigue severity varied by age (pinteraction = 0.003), functional impairment (pinteraction = 0.045) and physical activity pattern (pinteraction = 0.027). Patients who were younger, reported less functional impairments and had a fluctuating activity pattern benefitted more. The effect on physical functioning varied by self-efficacy (pinteraction = 0.025), with patients with higher self-efficacy benefitting most. No other moderators were found. It can be concluded from this study that CBT for ME/CFS can lead to significant reductions of fatigue, functional impairment, and physical limitations. There is no indication patients meeting different case definitions or reporting additional symptoms benefit less from CBT. Our findings do not support recent guidelines in which evidence from studies not mandating PEM was downgraded.},

This study describes the treatment choices and experiences of ME/CFS patients who have experienced variable levels of recovery. Method Interpretive description study consisting of semi-structured qualitative interviews with 33 people who met the US Centers for Disease Control (2015) diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS and report recovery or symptom improvement. Results Twenty-six participants endorsed partial recovery, and seven reported full recovery from ME/CFS. Participants reported expending significant time and energy to identify, implement, and adapt therapeutic interventions, often without the guidance of a medical practitioner. They formulated individualised treatment plans reflecting their understanding of their illness and personal resources. Most fully recovered participants attributed their success to mind-body approaches. Conclusion Patients with ME/CFS describe independently constructing and managing treatment plans, due to a lack of health system support.

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate longer term symptoms and health outcomes associated with post-covid-19 condition within a cohort of individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Design Population based, longitudinal cohort.
Setting General population of canton of Zurich, Switzerland.
Participants 1106 adults with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not vaccinated before infection and 628 adults who did not have an infection.
Main outcome measures Trajectories of self-reported health status and covid-19 related symptoms between months six, 12, 18, and 24 after infection and excess risk of symptoms at six months after infection compared with individuals who had no infection.
Results 22.9\% (95\% confidence interval 20.4\% to 25.6\%) of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 did not fully recover by six months. The proportion of individuals who had an infection who reported not having recovered decreased to 18.5\% (16.2\% to 21.1\%) at 12 months and 17.2\% (14.0\% to 20.8\%) at 24 months after infection. When assessing changes in self-reported health status, most participants had continued recovery (68.4\% (63.8\% to 72.6\%)) or had an overall improvement (13.5\% (10.6\% to 17.2\%)) over time. Yet, 5.2\% (3.5\% to 7.7\%) had a worsening in health status and 4.4\% (2.9\% to 6.7\%) had alternating periods of recovery and health impairment. The point prevalence and severity of covid-19 related symptoms also decreased over time, with 18.1\% (14.8\% to 21.9\%) reporting symptoms at 24 months. 8.9\% (6.5\% to 11.2\%) of participants reported symptoms at all four follow-up time points, while in 12.5\% (9.8\% to 15.9\%) symptoms were alternatingly absent and present. Symptom prevalence was higher among individuals who were infected compared with those who were not at six months (adjusted risk difference 17.0\% (11.5\% to 22.4\%)). Excess risk (adjusted risk difference) for individual symptoms among those infected ranged from 2\% to 10\%, with the highest excess risks observed for altered taste or smell (9.8\% (7.7\% to 11.8\%)), post-exertional malaise (9.4\% (6.1\% to 12.7\%)), fatigue (5.4\% (1.2\% to 9.5\%)), dyspnoea (7.8\% (5.2\% to 10.4\%)), and reduced concentration (8.3\% (6.0\% to 10.7\%)) and memory (5.7\% (3.5\% to 7.9\%)).
Conclusions Up to 18\% of individuals who were not vaccinated before infection had post-covid-19 condition up to two years after infection, with evidence of excess symptom risk compared with controls. Effective interventions are needed to reduce the burden of post-covid-19 condition. Use of multiple outcome measures and consideration of the expected rates of recovery and heterogeneity in symptom trajectories are important in the design and interpretation of clinical trials.

	abstract = {Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating multi-systemic chronic illness of unknown etiology, classified as a neurological disorder by the World Health Organization (WHO). The symptomatology of the condition appears to emanate from a variety of sources of chronic neurological disturbance and associated distortions, and chronicity, in noxious sensory signaling and neuroimmune activation. This article incorporates a summary review and discussion of biomedical research considered relevant to this essential conception perspective. It is intended to provide stakeholders with a concise, integrated outline disease model in order to help demystify this major public health problem. The primary etiopathological factors presented are: (A) Postural/biomechanical pain signaling, affecting adverse neuroexcitation, in the context of compression, constriction, strain, or damage of vertebral-regional bone and neuromuscular tissues; (B) Immune mediated inflammatory sequelae, in the context of prolonged immunotropic neurotrophic infection—with lymphotropic/gliotropic/glio-toxic varieties implicated in particular; (C) A combination of factors A and B. Sustained glial activation under such conditions is associated with oxidative and nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and neural sensitivity. These processes collectively enhance the potential for multi-systemic disarray involving endocrine pathway aberration, immune and mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurodegeneration, and tend toward still more intractable synergistic neuro-glial dysfunction (gliopathy), autoimmunity, and central neuronal sensitization.},

	abstract = {Background
Previous studies have shown evidence of comorbid conditions in chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME).
Objective
To estimate the prevalence of comorbidities and assess their associations using a nationwide population-based database of a Spanish CFS/ME cohort.
Method
A nationally representative, retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study (2008–2015) assessed 1757 Spanish subjects who met both the 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Fukuda definition and 2003 Canadian Criteria for CFS/ME. Sociodemographic and clinical data, comorbidities, and patient-reported outcome measures at baseline were recorded. A cluster analysis based on baseline clinical variables was performed to classify patients with CFS/ME into 5 categories according to comorbidities. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted adjusting for potential confounding effects such as age and sex; response and categorical predictor variables were also assessed.
Results
A total of 1757 CFS/ME patients completed surveys were collected. We identified 5 CFS/ME clusters: group 1—fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, multiple chemical hypersensitivity, sicca syndrome, epicondylitis, and thyroiditis; group 2—alterations of ligaments and subcutaneous tissue, hypovitaminosis D, psychopathology, ligamentous hyperlaxity, and endometriosis. These 2 subgroups comprised mainly older women, with low educational level, unemployment, high levels of fatigue, and poor quality of life; group 3—with hardly any comorbidities, comprising mainly younger women, university students or those already employed, with lower levels of fatigue, and better quality of life; group 4—poorly defined comorbidities; and group 5—hypercholesterolemia.
Conclusion
Over 80\% of a large population-based cohort of Spanish patients with CFS/ME presented comorbidities. Among the 5 subgroups created, the most interesting were groups 1–3. Future research should consider multidisciplinary approaches for the management and treatment of CFS/ME with comorbid conditions.},

	abstract = {Background
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a chronic incapacitating illness that affects between 400,000 and 800,000 Americans. Despite the disabling nature of this illness, scant research has addressed the economic impact of CFS either on those affected or on the national economy.

Methods
We used microsimulation methods to analyze data from a surveillance study of CFS in Wichita, Kansas, and derive estimates of productivity losses due to CFS.

Results
We estimated a 37\% decline in household productivity and a 54\% reduction in labor force productivity among people with CFS. The annual total value of lost productivity in the United States was \$9.1 billion, which represents about \$20,000 per person with CFS or approximately one-half of the household and labor force productivity of the average person with this syndrome.

Conclusion
Lost productivity due to CFS was substantial both on an individual basis and relative to national estimates for other major illnesses. CFS resulted in a national productivity loss comparable to such losses from diseases of the digestive, immune and nervous systems, and from skin disorders. The extent of the burden indicates that continued research to determine the cause and potential therapies for CFS could provide substantial benefit both for individual patients and for the nation.},

Global dysfunction was marked, as reported by patients on the Sickness Impact Profile. The mean score on the Sickness Impact Profile of 11.3 for fatigued patients is similar to that reported for patients with major medical illnesses.

	doi = {10.1080/21641846.2016.1236588},
	abstract = {Background
There is a dearth of research examining mortality in individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Some studies suggest there is an elevated risk of suicide and earlier mortality compared to national norms. However, findings are inconsistent as other researchers have not found significant increases in all-cause mortality for patients.

Objective
This study sought to determine if patients with ME or CFS are reportedly dying earlier than the overall population from the same cause.

Methods
Family, friends, and caregivers of deceased individuals with ME or CFS were recruited through social media, patient newsletters, emails, and advocate websites. This study analyzed data including cause and age of death for 56 individuals identified as having ME or CFS.

Results
The findings suggest patients in this sample are at a significantly increased risk of earlier all-cause (M = 55.9 years) and cardiovascular-related (M = 58.8 years) mortality, and they had a directionally lower mean age of death for suicide (M = 41.3 years) and cancer (M =66.3 years) compared to the overall U.S. population [M = 73.5 (all-cause), 77.7 (cardiovascular), 47.4 (suicide), and 71.1 (cancer) years of age].

Conclusions
The results suggest there is an increase in risk for earlier mortality in patients with ME and CFS. Due to the small sample size and over-representation of severely ill patients, the findings should be replicated to determine if the directional differences for suicide and cancer mortality are significantly different from the overall U.S. population.},

	abstract = {Fibromyalgia (FM) is a condition characterized by musculoskeletal pain and multiple comorbidities. Our study aimed to identify four clusters of FM patients according to their core clinical symptoms and neuropsychological comorbidities to identify possible therapeutic targets in the condition. We performed a population-based cohort study on 251 adult FM patients referred to primary care according to the 2010 ACR case criteria. Patients were aggregated in clusters by a K-medians hierarchical cluster analysis based on physical and emotional symptoms and neuropsychological variables. Four different clusters were identified in the FM population. Global cluster analysis reported a four-cluster profile (cluster 1: pain, fatigue, poorer sleep quality, stiffness, anxiety/depression and disability at work; cluster 2: injustice, catastrophizing, positive affect and negative affect; cluster 3: mindfulness and acceptance; and cluster 4: surrender). The second analysis on clinical symptoms revealed three distinct subgroups (cluster 1: fatigue, poorer sleep quality, stiffness and difficulties at work; cluster 2: pain; and cluster 3: anxiety and depression). The third analysis of neuropsychological variables provided two opposed subgroups (cluster 1: those with high scores in surrender, injustice, catastrophizing and negative affect, and cluster 2: those with high scores in acceptance, positive affect and mindfulness). These empirical results support models that assume an interaction between neurobiological, psychological and social factors beyond the classical biomedical model. A detailed assessment of such risk and protective factors is critical to differentiate FM subtypes, allowing for further identification of their specific needs and designing tailored personalized therapeutic interventions.},

The etiology is unknown; however, recent studies suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction has been involved in the pathophysiology of both conditions. We have investigated the possible association between mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress in patients with CFS and FM. We studied 23 CFS patients, 20 FM patients, and 15 healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell showed decreased levels of Coenzyme Q10 from CFS patients (p{\textless}0.001 compared with controls) and from FM subjects (p{\textless}0.001 compared with controls) and ATP levels for CFS patients (p{\textless}0.001 compared with controls) and for FM subjects (p{\textless}0.001 compared with controls). On the contrary, CFS/FM patients had significantly increased levels of lipid peroxidation, respectively (p{\textless}0.001 for both CFS and FM patients with regard to controls) that were indicative of oxidative stress-induced damage. Mitochondrial citrate synthase activity was significantly lower in FM patients (p{\textless}0.001) and, however, in CFS, it resulted in similar levels than controls. Mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNA/gDNA ratio) was normal in CFS and reduced in FM patients versus healthy controls, respectively (p{\textless}0.001). Expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-coactivator 1-alpha and transcription factor A, mitochondrial by immunoblotting were significantly lower in FM patients (p{\textless}0.001) and were normal in CFS subjects compared with healthy controls. These data lead to the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction-dependent events could be a marker of differentiation between CFS and FM, indicating the mitochondria as a new potential therapeutic target for these conditions.},

A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate \$t\$. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

We have explored human NK cell phenotypic and functional maturation in a rural African (Gambian) population with a high prevalence of HCMV. The effect of age on the frequency, absolute number, phenotype, and functional capacity of NK cells was monitored in 191 individuals aged from 1 to 49 years. Increasing frequencies of NK cells with age were associated with increased proportions of CD56dim cells expressing the differentiation marker CD57 and expansion of the NKG2C+ subset. Frequencies of NK cells responding to exogenous cytokines declined with age in line with a decreased proportion of CD57− cells. These changes coincided with a highly significant drop in anti-HCMV IgG titers by the age of 10 years, suggesting that HCMV infection is brought under control as NK cells differentiate (or vice versa). Deletion at the NKG2C locus was associated with a gene dose-dependent reduction in proportions of CD94+ and CD57+ NK cells. Importantly, anti-HCMV IgG titers were significantly elevated in NKG2C−/− children, suggesting that lack of expression of NKG2C may be associated with altered control of HCMV in childhood.},

	abstract = {Background
Considerable controversy has transpired regarding the core features of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Current case definitions differ in the number and types of symptoms required. This ambiguity impedes the search for biological markers and effective treatments.

Purpose
This study sought to empirically operationalize symptom criteria and identify which symptoms best characterize the illness.

Methods
Patients (n=236) and controls (n=86) completed the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, rating the frequency and severity of 54 symptoms. Responses were compared to determine the threshold of frequency/severity ratings that best distinguished patients from controls. A Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm was used to identify the combination of symptoms that most accurately classified patients and controls.

Results
A third of controls met the symptom criteria of a common CFS case definition when just symptom presence was required; however, when frequency/severity requirements were raised, only 5\% met criteria. Employing these higher frequency/severity requirements, the CART algorithm identified three symptoms that accurately classified 95.4\% of participants as patient or control: fatigue/extreme tiredness, inability to focus on multiple things simultaneously, and experiencing a dead/heavy feeling after starting to exercise.

Conclusions
Minimum frequency/severity thresholds should be specified in symptom criteria to reduce the likelihood of misclassification. Future research should continue to seek empirical support of the core symptoms of ME and CFS to further progress the search for biological markers and treatments.},

	abstract = {Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an intractable pathological state characterized by chronic fatigue for 6 months or more with unknown cause. For its diagnosis, it is necessary to exclude any physical or psychiatric conditions which could cause chronic fatigue. Psychiatric co-morbidity is commonly observed in cases diagnosed as CFS, and we propose a classification of the therapeutic role of physicians and psychiatrists according to the psychiatric classification of the chronic fatigue episode. Recently, a series of studies proved the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for CFS. In CBT for CFS, it is considered to be important not to seek physical causes, to accept the pathological state as it is, to monitor and record the patient’s daily activity and recognize the cognitive and behavioral patterns which might prolong fatigue, to maintain a constant activity level, and to make planned increases in daily activity. In CFS, our data showed that the rate of complete recovery was about 20\% at the 2-year follow-up, and 40\% at the 5-year follow-up, and that the prognosis of patients with psychiatric co-morbidity from the onset of a fatigue episode was far poorer than that of patients with no psychiatric co-morbidity or with psychiatric co-morbidity subsequent to a fatigue episode. We conclude that the psychiatric classification of the course of chronic fatigue is important for planning a therapeutic strategy and predicting the outcome of this state.},

	abstract = {The objective of our study was to develop a new fatigue scale for the assessment of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) as well as people who feel they are chronically fatigued but do not meet the diagnostic criteria for CFS. A new fatigue scale was developed by one psychiatrist and two physicians who specialize in CFS. This scale consists of various psychosomatic symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, and diagnostic criteria for CFS. It was completed by 325 patients with CFS, 311 fatigue patients who did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for CFS, 92 healthy workers, and 80 university students. The Chalder fatigue scale, the profile of mood states (POMS), the performance status (PS), which is included in the Japanese diagnostic criteria for CFS, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) for fatigue were also assessed with the agreement of patients who consulted our center from December 2004 to April 2006. Seventy-two university students also completed the questionnaire, including this new scale, the Chalder fatigue scale, and other lifestyle factors, and we reconfirmed the effectiveness of the new scale among fatigue patients with and without CFS and normal controls. There was a high degree of internal consistency in the results, and principal components analysis supported the notion of an 8-factor solution (42 items covering fatigue, anxiety and depression, loss of attention and memory, pain, overwork, autonomic imbalance, sleep problems, and infection). Only “anxiety and depression,” “pain,” and “infection” factors were able to distinguish CFS from not CFS. The sensitivity and specificity of CFS were 67.7 and 64.4, respectively, using a cut-off score of 25 points for this subscore. We concluded that the new fatigue scale used in this study was useful for differentiating CFS patients from not CFS patients and fatigued people from a healthy sample.},

To make this model, we kept rats for 5 days in a cage filled with water (23 ± 1°C) to a height of 1.5 cm, and for an evaluation of the extent of fatigue, a weight-loaded forced swimming test was used. The fatigued animals showed reduced brain energy utilization as compared with the controls. Although acutely stressed rats showed increased turnover of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, the fatigued rats did not show any change in the levels of these neurotransmitters and the metabolites in the brain regions in which the synaptic terminals are abundant. Hence, decreased energy utilization induced by prolonged deprivation of rest may introduce a vicious cycle of fatigue and lead to insufficient activation of the serotonin and dopamine systems in the brain. Since the serotonin and dopamine systems are not activated properly under the condition of fatigue, the fatigue sensation and physical activity may become insufficient, and in the terminal stage, long-term deprivation of rest may lead to death (Karoshi). We also found that by using this animal model of fatigue, we could screen for candidates for antifatigue substances for human use.},

	abstract = {Medically, nonexplained fatigue is a significant clinical and public health concern. However, the construct fatigue is not easily defined, and this is reflected in the large number of different scales used to measure fatigue. In this chapter, we define fatigue using the sustained stress activation theory. It is proposed that sustained stress, with a lack of sufficient recovery periods, is characterized by a decline in the ability to concentrate, be energetic, and sleep. Based on this definition, the brief fatigue syndrome scale (BFSS) was created using visual analogue scales (VAS) to rate self-assessed energy, ability to concentrate, and quality of sleep. The BFSS consisted of one factor, with a Cronbach’s α of {\textgreater}0.70. The validity and sensitivity of the scale was assessed by following a group of fatigued patients undergoing a 1-year lifestyle recovery program. In addition, a reference group of healthy controls was followed over the same period. Both groups responded regularly to a survey containing the BFSS. Blood samples were also collected during the first 6 months. The BFSS scores decreased significantly as the clinical conditions of the fatigued participants improved. Furthermore, self-rated mental energy, assessed by a separate and validated five-item Likert-type scale, improved with decreasing fatigue. Participants scoring above the proposed cut-off point of 8 for depression on the hospital depression and anxiety scale had significantly higher BFSS scores. BFSS scores were also higher among subjects scoring in the burn-out range on the Shirom-Melamed scale. Decreased fatigue over time was related to improved/ increased serum levels of testosterone. It is suggested that the cut-off point for fatigue vs. nonfatigue should be set at 40\%. The BFSS is suggested as a valid and quick instrument to assess fatigue.},

However, there have been few studies measuring the extent of the decrease in work efficiency due to mental fatigue, because previously there had been no established mental task that could measure the extent of work efficiency. In this study, we used a recently developed test to investigate changes in task performance over a 4-h period by 14 healthy volunteers. The mental tasks which the subjects performed were an advanced trail making test (ATMT) and a verbal 2-back task. The ATMT consists of selective attention and spatial working memory tests. The verbal 2-back task is a simple working memory test. The results of the ATMT showed an increase in the number of errors with time spent on the task. In contrast, the performance of the verbal 2-back test did not deteriorate with time spent on the task. These results suggest that mental fatigue induces a decrease in selective attention rather than in working memory. Therefore, the ATMT may be useful for measuring the extent of work efficiency during mental fatigue. In order to develop antifatigue medications and food supplements, the ATMT may also be useful for an objective evaluation of the extent of mental fatigue, as well as a fatigue-inducing task.},

Although it is difficult to determine with precision the economic loss caused by fatigue, there is no question that the successful suppression of chronic fatigue (which is one factor responsible for the onset or exacerbation of lifestyle-related chronic diseases) will greatly contribute to decreasing medical expenditure. It is known that major signs of fatigue, which appear in the form of compromised physical and mental function, are closely related to the function of the frontal lobes (which may be the center for fatigue recognition) and of the autonomic nervous system. For this reason, the quantification of fatigue requires the development of biomarkers capable of objectively and sensitively evaluating changes in frontal lobe function (working memory, etc.) and autonomic nervous system function (pulse waves, etc.). Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of fatigue will be possible by meta-analyses of changes in biochemical, immunological, and physiological markers in blood, saliva, and urine, as well as changes in brain function imaging in the presence of mental or physical stress.},

	abstract = {For many years, it has generally been believed that the accumulations of lactate (lactic acid) in muscles and in the central nervous system are associated with peripheral and central nervous system fatigue, respectively. We conducted an overview of the roles of lactate, which have recently been clarified, under the condition of fatigue. First, the intra-cellular acidification of muscle caused by an accumulation of lactate has protective effects during muscle fatigue. The excitation-induced accumulation of extracellular K+ leads action potentials to be a less effective trigger of Ca2+ release in working muscles, and acidification by the accumulation of lactate reduces this effect by decreasing the contribution of Cl− channels, which act to keep the membrane potential near the Cl− reversal potential. Since the Cl− reversal potential is near the resting membrane potential, the effect of Cl− channel activity is to increase the Na+ current necessary to generate an action potential, which triggers Ca2+ release. Second, in the central nervous system, lactate generated in astrocytes contributes to the activity-dependent fuelling of the neuronal energy demands associated with synaptic transmission, and administered lactate can also be utilized as energy substrates. Finally, an increased blood lactate level during muscle fatigue is not associated with central fatigue. From these results, we can conclude that lactate is a favorable substrate rather than the cause of fatigue.},

	abstract = {Fatigue is an integral component of illness and sickness behavior. This chapter reviews possible links between fatigue, mood states, immunodepression, and the incidence of illness, particularly upper respiratory tract infections. In terms of fatigue, our work has focused mainly on the biochemical markers (tryptophan, branched chain amino acids) involved in central fatigue in endurance athletes (with/without unexplained underperformance syndrome) in chronic fatigue syndrome, and in postoperative fatigue. We have also looked at tryptophan from a different perspective by undertaking a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on the brain in healthy humans, with/without tryptophan supplementation, undertaking a cognition function task. The availability of tryptophan has consequences for immune function. In prolonged exercise, mucosal protection may be impaired as a consequence of oronasal breathing. Individuals involved in our studies have often had a high incidence of minor illnesses, particularly upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), after prolonged, exhaustive exercise such as a marathon race, or intensive training. A concomitant decrease in plasma glutamine has been a frequent feature of these studies. Mood profiles and other parameters were assessed in military personnel undertaking intensive training in harsh environments: fatigue and other negative mood states were increased at the same time as the highest incidence of URTI. Sleep deprivation was a factor in this study, and a subsequent investigation of one night’s sleep loss demonstrated changes in some parameters involved in immune function concomitant with decreased cognitive ability. As well as a variety of metabolites, the cytokines, both pro- and antiinflammatory, clearly have an important role in all the circumstances mentioned above.},

	abstract = {Severe persistent or relapsing fatigue is the most disabling symptom in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Clinical and brain imaging studies with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy support the view that fatigue in CFS is central, i.e., brain-derived. It seems likely that an interruption of the basal ganglia pathways integrating voluntary motor output to the afferent sensory input and cognitive processing is the neural basis of fatigue in CFS. A genome-wide microarray study in patients with CFS suggests significant changes in gene expression of pathways responsible for immune modulation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Altered neural cell membrane signalling in regional brain areas induced by downstream effects of these changes may explain the paroxysmal and fluctuating nature of symptom severity in many CFS patients. It is possible, but not yet proven, that CFS is due to a neurological channelopathy.},

	abstract = {The clinical symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been shown to include disorders in the neuroendocrine, autonomic, and immune systems. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that cytokines produced in the brain play significant roles in neural-immune interactions through their various central actions, such as activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and sympathetic nervous system. We have recently developed an animal model for fatigue induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of synthetic double-stranded RNAs, polyriboinosinic: polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C, 3 mg/kg), in rats, and shown a decrease in the daily amounts of spontaneous running-wheel activity to about 60\% of the preinjection level for more than 1 week. Simultaneously, mRNAs for interferon-α (IFN-α) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT), which is known to be induced by IFN-α, increased for more than a week following poly I:C injection in the same hypothalamic nuclei and cortex. The increased 5-HTT had a functional significance, since in vivo brain microdialysis revealed that an i.p. injection of poly I:C induced a decrease in the extracellular concentration of 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex, which was blocked by a local perfusion with the selective 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine. Finally the poly I:C-induced fatigue was attenuated by 5-HT1A receptor agonist, but not by 5-HT2, 5-HT3, or dopamine D3 agonists. These findings suggested that the decrease in 5-HT actions on 5-HT1A receptors may at least partly contribute to the poly I:C-induced fatigue.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms of the manifestation of central fatigue were studied. In the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from exercise-fatigued rats there was a factor that depressed the spontaneous motor activity (SMA) of the animals and caused the kind of behavior that is observed in exhausted animals. A bioassay which utilized hydra, a freshwater coelenterate, strongly suggested the existence of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the CSF. Because the immunoneutralizing treatment of the CSF from fatigued rats with anti-TGF-β antibody eliminated the factor that depresses the SMA of animals, the identity of this factor was shown to be TGF-β. The findings that the intracisternal administration of purified TGF-β depressed the SMA in a dose-dependent manner, and that the concentration of TGF-β in the CSF increased with an increase in the intensity of the exercise which was being used to cause fatigue, supported the speculation that this factor was responsible for the manifestation of central fatigue. In addition, we also demonstrated that TGF-β acted on the brain and modulated the activities of neurons, and that this changed the whole body metabolism to utilize more fat and enhanced the oxidation of fatty acid.},

Cohort 1 of 257 CFS and 456 control subjects were compared using the Medical Research Council chronic Dyspnea Scale (MRC Score; range 0-5). Cohort 2 of 106 CFS and 90 controls answered a Dyspnea Severity Score (range 0-20) adapted from the MRC Score. Subsets of both cohorts completed CFS Severity Scores, fatigue, and other questionnaires. A subset had pulmonary function and total lung capacity measurements. Results show MRC Scores were equivalent between sexes in Cohort 1 CFS (1.92 [1.72-2.16]; mean [95\% C.I.]) and controls (0.31 [0.23-0.39]; p{\textless}0.0001). Receiver-operator curves identified 2 as the threshold for positive MRC Scores in Cohort 1. This indicated 54\% of CFS, but only 3\% of controls, had significant dyspnea. In Cohort 2, Dyspnea Score threshold of 4 indicated shortness of breath in 67\% of CFS and 23\% of controls. Cohort 2 Dyspnea Scores were higher for CFS (7.80 [6.60-9.00]) than controls (2.40 [1.60-3.20]; p{\textless}0.0001). CFS had significantly worse fatigue and other complaints compared to controls. Pulmonary function was normal in CFS, but Borg scores and sensations of chest pain and dizziness were significantly greater during testing than controls. General linear model of Cohort 2 CFS responses linked Dyspnea with rapid heart rate, chest pain and dizziness. In conclusion, sensory hypersensitivity without airflow limitation contributed to dyspnea in CFS. Correlates of dyspnea in controls were distinct from CFS suggesting different mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Infections by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are often at the disease onset of patients suffering from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). However, serological analyses of these infections remain inconclusive when comparing patients with healthy controls (HCs). In particular, it is unclear if certain EBV-derived antigens eliciting antibody responses have a biomarker potential for disease diagnosis. With this purpose, we re-analyzed a previously published microarray data on the IgG antibody responses against 3,054 EBV-related antigens in 92 patients with ME/CFS and 50 HCs. This re-analysis consisted of constructing different regression models for binary outcomes with the ability to classify patients and HCs. In these models, we tested for a possible interaction of different antibodies with age and gender. When analyzing the whole data set, there were no antibody responses that could distinguish patients from healthy controls. A similar finding was obtained when comparing patients with non-infectious or unknown disease trigger with healthy controls. However, when data analysis was restricted to the comparison between HCs and patients with a putative infection at their disease onset, we could identify stronger antibody responses against two candidate antigens (EBNA4\_0529 and EBNA6\_0070). Using antibody responses to these two antigens together with age and gender, the final classification model had an estimated sensitivity and specificity of 0.833 and 0.720, respectively. This reliable case-control discrimination suggested the use of the antibody levels related to these candidate viral epitopes as biomarkers for disease diagnosis in this subgroup of patients. To confirm this finding, a follow-up study will be conducted in a separate cohort of patients.},

We characterised post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and identified key symptoms associated with persistent disease. We estimated incidence rates of persisting symptoms in the general population and among COVID-19 patients over time. Subsequently, we investigated which WHO-listed symptoms were particularly differential by comparing their frequency in COVID-19 cases vs. matched test-negative controls. Lastly, we compared persistent symptoms after first infections vs. reinfections.Our study shows that the proportion of COVID-19 cases affected by persistent post-acute COVID-19 symptoms declined over the study period. Risk for altered smell/taste was consistently higher in patients with COVID-19 vs test-negative controls. Persistent symptoms were more common after reinfection than following a first infection. More research is needed into the definition of long COVID, and the effect of interventions to minimise the risk and impact of persistent symptoms.},

	abstract = {The historical origin and the experimental basis of the concept of physical determinism indicate that this basis was removed with the acceptance of the kinetic theory of matter, while its difficulties are increased by the admission that human nature, in its entirety, is a product of natural causation. An indeterministic view of causation has the advantages (a) of unifying the concept of natural law in different spheres of human experience and (b) of a greater generality, which precludes the acceptance of the special case of completely deterministic causation, so long as this is an unproved assumption. It is not inconsistent with the orderliness of the world, or with the fruitful pursuit of natural knowledge. It enriches rather than weakens the concept of of causation. It possesses definite advantages with respect to the one-sidedness of human memory, and to the phenomena of aiming and striving observable in man and other animals. Among biological theories it appears to be most completely in harmony with the theory of natural selection, which in its statistical nature resembles the second law of thermo-dynamics. In an indeterministic world natural causation has a creative element, and science is interested in locating the original causes of effects of special interest, and not merely in pushing a chain of causation backwards ad infinitum. These contrasting tendencies are illustrated by a critique of the mutation theory, and by an attempt more closely to define the sense in which indeterministic causation should be thought of as creative.},

	abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a neglected, debilitating multi-systemic disease without diagnostic marker or therapy. Despite evidence for neurological, immunological, infectious, muscular and endocrine pathophysiological abnormalities, the etiology and a clear pathophysiology remains unclear. The gut microbiome gained much attention in the last decade with manifold implications in health and disease. Here we review the current state of knowledge on the interplay between ME/CFS and the microbiome, to identify potential diagnostic or interventional approaches, and propose areas where further research is needed. We iteratively selected and elaborated on key theories about a correlation between microbiome state and ME/CFS pathology, developing further hypotheses. Based on the literature we hypothesize that antibiotic use throughout life favours an intestinal microbiota composition which might be a risk factor for ME/CFS. Main proposed pathomechanisms include gut dysbiosis, altered gut-brain axis activity, increased gut permeability with concomitant bacterial translocation and reduced levels of short-chain-fatty acids, D-lactic acidosis, an abnormal tryptophan metabolism and low activity of the kynurenine pathway. We review options for microbiome manipulation in ME/CFS patients including probiotic and dietary interventions as well as fecal microbiota transplantations. Beyond increasing gut permeability and bacterial translocation, specific dysbiosis may modify fermentation products, affecting peripheral mitochondria. Considering the gut-brain axis we strongly suspect that the microbiome may contribute to neurocognitive impairments of ME/CFS patients. Further larger studies are needed, above all to clarify whether D-lactic acidosis and early-life antibiotic use may be part of ME/CFS etiology and what role changes in the tryptophan metabolism might play. An association between the gut microbiome and the disease ME/CFS is plausible. As causality remains unclear, we recommend longitudinal studies. Activity levels, bedridden hours and disease progression should be compared to antibiotic exposure, drug intakes and alterations in the composition of the microbiota. The therapeutic potential of fecal microbiota transfer and of targeted dietary interventions should be systematically evaluated.},

Following an infectious onset patients suffer from severe central and muscle fatigue, chronic pain, cognitive impairment, and immune and autonomic dysfunction. Although the etiology of CFS/ME is not solved yet, there is numerous evidence for an autoantibody mediated dysregulation of the immune and autonomic nervous system. We found elevated ß2 adrenergic receptor (ß2AdR) and M3 acetylcholine receptor antibodies in a subset of CFS/ME patients. As both ß2AdR and M3 acetylcholine receptor are important vasodilators, we would expect their functional disturbance to result in vasoconstriction and hypoxemia. An impaired circulation and oxygen supply could result in many symptoms of ME/CFS. There are consistent reports of vascular dysfunction in ME/CFS. Muscular and cerebral hypoperfusion has been shown in ME/CFS in various studies and correlated with fatigue. Metabolic changes in ME/CFS are also in line with a concept of hypoxia and ischemia. Here we try to develop a unifying working concept for the complex pathomechanism of ME/CFS based on the presence of dysfunctional autoantibodies against ß2AdR and M3 acetylcholine receptor and extrapolate it to the pathophysiology of ME/CFS without an autoimmune pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Autoimmunity and chronic viral infections are recurrent clinical observations in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), a complex disease with an unknown cause. Given these observations, the regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) show promise to be good candidates for the underlying pathology due to their capacity to suppress the immune responses against both self and microbial antigens. Here, we discussed the overlooked role of these cells in the chronicity of Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV6), Herpes Simplex 1 (HSV1), and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), as often reported as triggers of ME/CFS. Using simulations of the cross-regulation model for the dynamics of Tregs, we illustrated that mild infections might lead to a chronically activated immune responses under control of Tregs if the responding clone has a high autoimmune potential. Such infections promote persistent inflammation and possibly fatigue. We then hypothesized that ME/CFS is a condition characterized by a predominance of this type of infections under control of Tregs. In contrast, healthy individuals are hypothesized to trigger immune responses of a virus-specific clone with a low autoimmune potential. According to this hypothesis, simple model simulations of the CD4+ T-cell repertoire could reproduce the increased density and percentages of Tregs observed in patients suffering from the disease, when compared to healthy controls. A deeper analysis of Tregs in the pathogenesis of ME/CFS will help to assess the validity of this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {ObjectivesThis systematic review summarizes research on methods of diagnosing myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and benefits and harms of multiple medical and nonmedical treatments. It identifies evidence gaps and limitations to inform future research.Data sourcesSearches of electronic databases included MEDLINE® (1988 to September 2014), PsycINFO® (1988 to September 2014), and the Cochrane Library (through the third quarter of 2014). The searches were supplemented by reviewing reference lists, seeking suggestions from reviewers, and requesting scientific information from drug and device manufacturers.Review methodsTwo investigators reviewed abstracts and full-text articles for inclusion based on predefined criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus, with a third investigator making the final decision.ResultsA total of 6,175 potentially relevant articles were identified, 1,069 were selected for full-text review, and 71 studies in 81 publications were included (36 observational studies on diagnosis and 35 trials of treatments). Eight case definitions have been used to define ME/CFS; those for ME, requiring the presence of postexertional malaise, represent a more symptomatic subset of the broader ME/CFS population. Researchers are unable to determine differences in accuracy between case definitions because there is no universally accepted reference standard for diagnosing ME/CFS. The Oxford criteria are the least restrictive and include patients who would not otherwise meet criteria for ME/CFS. Self-reported symptom scales may differentiate ME/CFS patients from healthy controls but have not been adequately evaluated to determine validity and generalizability in large populations with diagnostic uncertainty. Fourteen studies reported the consequences of diagnosis, including perceived stigma and the burden of misdiagnosis, as well as feelings of legitimacy upon receiving the diagnosis of ME/CFS.Of the 35 trials of treatment, rintatolimod compared with placebo improved measures of exercise performance; counseling therapies and graded exercise treatment (GET) compared with no treatment, relaxation, or support improved fatigue, function, and quality of life, and counseling therapies also improved employment outcomes. Other treatments either provided no benefit or results were insufficient to draw conclusions. GET was associated with higher numbers of reported adverse events compared with counseling therapies or controls. Harms were generally inadequately reported across trials.LimitationsDiagnostic methods were studied only in highly selected patient populations. Treatment trials were limited in number and had small sample sizes and methodological shortcomings.ConclusionsNone of the current diagnostic methods have been adequately tested to identify patients with ME/CFS when diagnostic uncertainty exists. Rintatolimod improves exercise performance in some patients (low strength of evidence), while counseling therapies and GET have broader benefit but have not been adequately tested in more disabled populations (low to moderate strength of evidence). Other treatments and harms have been inadequately studied (insufficient evidence). More definitive studies are needed to fill the many research gaps in diagnosing and treating ME/CFS.},

	abstract = {Misdiagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) can occur when different case definitions are used by clinicians (relative misdiagnosis) or when failing the genuine diagnosis of another disease (misdiagnosis in a strict sense). This problem translates to a recurrent difficulty in reproducing research findings. To tackle this problem, we simulated data from case-control studies under misdiagnosis in a strict sense. We then estimated the power to detect a genuine association between a potential causal factor and ME/CFS. A minimum power of 80\% was obtained for studies with more than 500 individuals per study group. When the simulation study was extended to the situation where the potential causal factor could not be determined perfectly (e.g., seropositive/seronegative in serological association studies), the minimum power of 80\% could only be achieved in studies with more than 1000 individuals per group. In conclusion, current ME/CFS studies have suboptimal power under the assumption of misdiagnosis. This power can be improved by increasing the overall sample size using multi-centric studies, reporting the excluded illnesses and their exclusion criteria, or focusing on a homogeneous cohort of ME/CFS patients with a specific pathological mechanism where the chance of misdiagnosis is reduced.},

Methods: Using data mining, we compared and contrasted fundamental features of consensus-based criteria versus empirical latent factors. In general, these approaches found the domain of fatigue/post-exertional malaise as best differentiating patients from controls. Results: Findings indicated that the Fukuda et al. criteria had the worst sensitivity and specificity.

With various countries targeting disease elimination in the near future, the popular parasite infection or entomological inoculation rates are becoming less and less informative of the underlying malaria burden due to a reduced number of infected individuals or mosquitoes at the time of sampling. To overcome such problem, alternative measures based on antibodies against specific malaria antigens have gained recent interest in malaria epidemiology due to the possibility of estimating past disease exposure in absence of infected individuals. This paper aims then to review current mathematical models and corresponding statistical approaches used in antibody data analysis. The application of these models is illustrated with three data sets from Equatorial Guinea, Brazilian Amazonia region, and western Kenyan highlands.

As such, it is conducted under uncertainty using symptom-based criteria and the exclusion of known diseases. The possibility of misdiagnosing patients reduces the power to detect new and previously identified factors that can be associated with the disease. To investigate this problem, we previously conducted a simulation study to estimate the power of case-control association studies as a function of the misdiagnosed rate. Here we extended this simulation study to the more general situation where there is also the possibility of having misclassification in a binary factor related to a previous exposure to a given infection. Given the suggested link between ME/CFS and past viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19), we performed the simulation study in the specific context of serological testing of this new coronavirus using published data from Portuguese, Spanish and Iranian seroepidemiological studies.},

These approaches provide a rich portrait of genes, molecular pathways and cell types involved in disease phenotypes. Machine learning (ML) can be a useful tool for extracting disease-relevant patterns from high-dimensional datasets. However, depending upon the complexity of the biological question, machine learning often requires many samples to identify recurrent and biologically meaningful patterns. Rare diseases are inherently limited in clinical cases, leading to few samples to study. In this Perspective, we outline the challenges and emerging solutions for using ML for small sample sets, specifically in rare diseases. Advances in ML methods for rare diseases are likely to be informative for applications beyond rare diseases for which few samples exist with high-dimensional data. We propose that the method community prioritize the development of ML techniques for rare disease research.},

The most popular models are the so-called Gaussian mixture models which assume a Normal distribution for each component of a mixture. In this work, we propose the use of finite mixture models based on a flexible class of scale mixtures of Skew-Normal distributions for serological data analysis. These distributions are sufficiently flexible to describe right and left asymmetry often observed in the distributions associated with hypothetical antibody-negative and antibody-positive individuals, respectively. We illustrate the advantage of these alternative mixture models with a data set of 406 individuals in which antibodies against six different human herpesviruses were measured in the context of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.},

	abstract = {Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease of unknown etiology. Multiple studies point to disruptions in immune functioning in ME/CFS patients as well as specific genetic polymorphisms and alterations of the DNA methylome in lymphocytes. However, potential interactions between DNA methylation and genetic background in relation to ME/CFS have not been examined. In this study we explored this association by characterizing the epigenetic ( 480 thousand CpG loci) and genetic ( 4.3 million SNPs) variation between cohorts of ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. We found significant associations of DNA methylation states in T-lymphocytes at several CpG loci and regions with ME/CFS phenotype. These methylation anomalies are in close proximity to genes involved with immune function and cellular metabolism. Finally, we found significant correlations of genotypes with methylation modifications associated with ME/CFS. The findings from this study highlight the role of epigenetic and genetic interactions in complex diseases, and suggest several genetic and epigenetic elements potentially involved in the mechanisms of disease in ME/CFS.},

To characterize latent components of genetic associations, we apply truncated singular value decomposition (DeGAs) to matrices of summary statistics derived from genome-wide association analyses across 2,138 phenotypes measured in 337,199 White British individuals in the UK Biobank study. We systematically identify key components of genetic associations and the contributions of variants, genes, and phenotypes to each component. As an illustration of the utility of the approach to inform downstream experiments, we report putative loss of function variants, rs114285050 (GPR151) and rs150090666 (PDE3B), that substantially contribute to obesity-related traits and experimentally demonstrate the role of these genes in adipocyte biology. Our approach to dissect components of genetic associations across the human phenome will accelerate biomedical hypothesis generation by providing insights on previously unexplored latent structures.},

Despite a prevalence of ∼0.2–0.4\% and its high public health burden, and evidence that it has a heritable component, ME/CFS has not yet benefited from the advances in technology and analytical tools that have improved our understanding of many other complex diseases. Here we critically review existing evidence that genetic factors alter ME/CFS risk before concluding that most ME/CFS candidate gene associations are not replicated by the larger CFS cohort within the UK Biobank. Multiple genome-wide association studies of this cohort also have not yielded consistently significant associations. Ahead of upcoming larger genome-wide association studies, we discuss how these could generate new lines of enquiry into the DNA variants, genes and cell types that are causally involved in ME/CFS disease.},

Hereditability is suggested by an increased disease risk in relatives, however, genome-wide association studies in ME/CFS have been limited by small sample sizes and broad diagnostic criteria, therefore no established risk loci exist to date. In this study, we have analyzed three ME/CFS cohorts: a Norwegian discovery cohort (N = 427), a Danish replication cohort (N = 460) and a replication dataset from the UK biobank (N = 2105). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ME/CFS genome-wide association study of this magnitude incorporating 2532 patients for the genome-wide analyses and 460 patients for a targeted analysis. Even so, we did not find any ME/CFS risk loci displaying genome-wide significance. In the Norwegian discovery cohort, the TPPP gene region showed the most significant association (rs115523291, P = 8.5 × 10−7), but we could not replicate the top SNP. However, several other SNPs in the TPPP gene identified in the Norwegian discovery cohort showed modest association signals in the self-reported UK biobank CFS cohort, which was also present in the combined analysis of the Norwegian and UK biobank cohorts, TPPP (rs139264145; P = 0.00004). Interestingly, TPPP is expressed in brain tissues, hence it will be interesting to see whether this association, with time, will be verified in even larger cohorts. Taken together our study, despite being the largest to date, could not establish any ME/CFS risk loci, but comprises data for future studies to accumulate the power needed to reach genome-wide significance.},

The papers identified were reviewed following the synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) methodology, and were classified according to the focus of the enquiry (patients, GPs, database and medical record studies, evaluation of a training programme, and overview papers), and whether they were quantitative or qualitative in nature; Results: Thirty-three papers were identified in the MEDLINE search. The quantitative surveys of GPs demonstrated that a third to a half of all GPs did not accept ME/CFS as a genuine clinical entity and, even when they did, they lacked confidence in diagnosing or managing it. It should be noted, though, that these papers were mostly from the United Kingdom. Patient surveys indicated that a similar proportion of patients was dissatisfied with the primary medical care they had received. These findings were consistent with the findings of the qualitative studies that were examined, and have changed little over several decades; Conclusions: Disbelief and lack of knowledge and understanding of ME/CFS among GPs is widespread, and the resultant diagnostic delays constitute a risk factor for severe and prolonged disease. Failure to diagnose ME/CFS renders problematic attempts to determine its prevalence, and hence its economic impact.},

ME/CFS causes a significant personal and public health burden, and urgently requires the coordination of research efforts to investigate its etiology and pathophysiology and to develop and validate sensitive and specific biomarkers to confirm diagnosis. This narrative paper describes how people with ME/CFS, together with a multidisciplinary team of researchers, have established the UK ME/CFS Biobank (UKMEB), a unique research infrastructure specifically designed to expedite biomedical research into ME/CFS. We describe the journey that led to its conceptualization and operation, and how the resource has served as a model disease-specific biobank, aggregating human biospecimens alongside comprehensive health information on participants. The UKMEB currently has data and samples from 600 donors including people with ME/CFS and a comparison group with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls. A longitudinal sub-cohort has been established of participants having follow-up assessments at multiple time-points. As an open resource for quality and ethical research into ME/CFS, biological samples and data have not only been analyzed within our research team but have also been shared with researchers across Europe, America and the Middle East. We continue to encourage researchers from academic and commercial sectors to access the UKMEB. Major steps have been taken and challenges remain; these include sustainability and expansion, and harmonization of processes to facilitate integration with other bioresources and databanks internationally.},

DESIGN: cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Poland.
PARTICIPANTS: Of the cohort of 1400 who self-presented with fatigue only 69 subsequently were confirmed as having CFS/ME using the Fukuda criteria.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed the following screening symptom assessment tools: Chalder Fatigue Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (COMPASS 31), Quality of Life Scale (QOLS). Haemodynamic and autonomic parameters were automatically measured at rest with a Task Force Monitor.
RESULTS: In 1308, from 1400 (93\%) individuals who identified themselves as fatigued, recognised chronic conditions were identified, for example, neurological (n=280, 21.5\%), neurodegenerative (n=200, 15\%), psychiatric (n=654, 50\%) and immunologic (n=174, 13.5\%) disorders. The remaining 69 participants (mean age 38.3±8.5) met the Fukuda defintion for CFS/ME and had baseline objective assessment. The majority had experienced symptoms for over 2 years with 37\% having symptoms for 2-5 years and 21.7\% for more than 10 years. The COMPASS 31 indicated that 50\% have symptoms consistent with orthostatic intolerance. About 43/69 (62\%) had Epworth sleepiness scores ≥10, ie, consistent with excessive daytime sleepiness, 26/69 (38\%) had significant anxiety and 22/69 (32\%) depression measured by HADS A \& D. Quality of life is significantly impaired in those with Fukuda criteria CFS (QLS score 64±11) with significant negative relationships between quality of life and fatigue (p{\textless}0.0001), anxiety (p=0.0009), depression (p{\textless}0.0001) and autonomic symptoms (p=0.04).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to summarise illness characteristics of Polish CFS/ME patients. Our study has confirmed that fatigue is a common and under-recognised symptom affecting the Polish population.},

	abstract = {The etiology of myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is unknown, but involvement of the immune system is one of the proposed underlying mechanisms. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations are hallmarks of immune-mediated and autoimmune diseases. We have previously performed high resolution HLA genotyping and detected associations between ME/CFS and certain HLA class I and class II alleles. However, the HLA complex harbors numerous genes of immunological importance, and there is extensive and complex linkage disequilibrium across the region. In the current study, we aimed to fine map the association signals in the HLA complex by genotyping five additional classical HLA loci and 5,342 SNPs in 427 Norwegian ME/CFS patients, diagnosed according to the Canadian Consensus Criteria, and 480 healthy Norwegian controls. SNP association analysis revealed two distinct and independent association signals (p ≤ 0.001) tagged by rs4711249 in the HLA class I region and rs9275582 in the HLA class II region. Furthermore, the primary association signal in the HLA class II region was located within the HLA-DQ gene region, most likely due to HLA-DQB1, particularly the amino acid position 57 (aspartic acid/alanine) in the peptide binding groove, or an intergenic SNP upstream of HLA-DQB1. In the HLA class I region, the putative causal locus might map outside the classical HLA genes as the association signal spans several genes (DDR1, GTF2H4, VARS2, SFTA2 and DPCR1) with expression levels influenced by the ME/CFS associated SNP genotype. Taken together, our results implicate the involvement of the MHC, and in particular the HLA-DQB1 gene, in ME/CFS. These findings should be replicated in larger cohorts, particularly to verify the putative involvement of HLA-DQB1, a gene important for antigen-presentation to T cells and known to harbor alleles providing the largest risk for well–established autoimmune diseases.},

The Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFQ) is a widely used instrument to assess fatigue in both clinical and nonclinical settings. Psychometric properties of the scale and discriminative abilities were examined.
Methods
A total of 361 patients with CFS and 1615 individuals in the community were assessed with the CFQ. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to explore the structure of the scale. Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to investigate the discriminative properties.
Results
Two components, physical and mental fatigue, were identified in the CFS patient group and in the general population samples. Area under the curve for ROC was .91. The fatigue scale effectively discriminates, at high scores, between CFS patients and the general population.
Conclusion
Physical and mental fatigue are clearly separable components of fatigue. The CFQ can discriminate reliably between clinical and nonclinical conditions.},

In a subset of patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) disease starts with infectious mononucleosis as late primary EBV-infection, whereby altered levels of EBV-specific antibodies can be observed in another subset of patients. Methods We performed a comprehensive mapping of the IgG response against EBV comparing 50 healthy controls with 92 CFS patients using a microarray platform. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cancer-related fatigue served as controls. 3054 overlapping peptides were synthesised as 15-mers from 14 different EBV proteins. Array data was validated by ELISA for selected peptides. Prevalence of EBV serotypes was determined by qPCR from throat washing samples. Results EBV type 1 infections were found in patients and controls. EBV seroarray profiles between healthy controls and CFS were less divergent than that observed for MS or SLE. We found significantly enhanced IgG responses to several EBNA-6 peptides containing a repeat sequence in CFS patients compared to controls. EBNA-6 peptide IgG responses correlated well with EBNA-6 protein responses. The EBNA-6 repeat region showed sequence homologies to various human proteins. Conclusion Patients with CFS had a quite similar EBV IgG antibody response pattern as healthy controls. Enhanced IgG reactivity against an EBNA-6 repeat sequence and against EBNA-6 protein is found in CFS patients. Homologous sequences of various human proteins with this EBNA-6 repeat sequence might be potential targets for antigenic mimicry.},

	abstract = {Background: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a multisystem disease, the pathogenesis of which remains undetermined.
Aims: To test the hypothesis that there are reproducible abnormalities of gene expression in patients with CFS compared with normal healthy persons.
Methods: To gain further insight into the pathogenesis of this disease, gene expression was analysed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 25 patients with CFS diagnosed according to the Centers for Disease Control criteria and 25 normal blood donors matched for age, sex, and geographical location, using a single colour microarray representing 9522 human genes. After normalisation, average difference values for each gene were compared between test and control groups using a cutoff fold difference of expression ⩾ 1.5 and a p value of 0.001. Genes showing differential expression were further analysed using Taqman real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in fresh samples.
Results: Analysis of microarray data revealed differential expression of 35 genes. Real time PCR confirmed differential expression in the same direction as array results for 16 of these genes, 15 of which were upregulated (ABCD4, PRKCL1, MRPL23, CD2BP2, GSN, NTE, POLR2G, PEX16, EIF2B4, EIF4G1, ANAPC11, PDCD2, KHSRP, BRMS1, and GABARAPL1) and one of which was downregulated (IL-10RA). This profile suggests T cell activation and perturbation of neuronal and mitochondrial function. Upregulation of neuropathy target esterase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G1 may suggest links with organophosphate exposure and virus infection, respectively.
Conclusion: These results suggest that patients with CFS have reproducible alterations in gene regulation.},

The issue of variability in CFS research was recently highlighted at the NIH’s 2011 State of the Knowledge of CFS meeting prompting researchers to consider the critical information that should be included in CFS research reports. To address this problem, we present our consensus on the minimum data elements that should be included in all CFS research reports, along with additional elements that are currently being evaluated in specific research studies that show promise as important patient descriptors for subgrouping of CFS. These recommendations are intended to improve the consistency of reported methods and the interpretability of reported results. Adherence to minimum standards and increased reporting consistency will allow for better comparisons among published CFS articles, provide guidance for future research and foster the generation of knowledge that can directly benefit the patient.},

	abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are serious, debilitating conditions that affect millions of people in the United States and around the world. ME{\textbackslash}/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME{\textbackslash}/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms.{\textbackslash}nBeyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis{\textbackslash}/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME{\textbackslash}/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis{\textbackslash}/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care.{\textbackslash}nBeyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis{\textbackslash}/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment.},

	abstract = {The chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), formerly known as chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, is a clinical state of some complexity and uncertain etiology. In order to characterize in a comprehensive manner the status of laboratory markers associated with cellular immune function in patients with this syndrome, 30 patients with clinically defined CFS were studied. All of the subjects were found to have multiple abnormalities in these markers. The most consistent immunological abnormality detected among these patients, when compared with normal controls, was low natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. The number of NK cells, as defined by reactivity with monoclonal antibody NKH.1 (CD56), was elevated, but the killing of K562 tumor cells per CD56 cell was significantly diminished. Lymphoproliferative responses after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen were decreased in most patients when compared with those in normal controls, as was the production of gamma interferon following mitogen stimulation. Lymphocyte phenotypic marker analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes showed that there were significant differences between patients with CFS and controls. There was an increase in the percentage of suppressor-cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD8, and a proportionally larger increase in the number of CD8 cells expressing the class II activation marker. Most patients had an elevated number of CD2 cells which expressed the activation marker CDw26. The numbers of CD4 cells and the helper subset of CD4+CD29+ cells in patients with CFS were not different from those in controls. There was, however, a significant decrease in the suppressor inducer subset of CD4+ CD45RA+ cells. The number of B cells, CD20 and CD21, were elevated, as were the numbers of a subset of B cells which coexpressed CD20 and CD5. The patterns of immune marker abnormalities observed was compatible with a chronic viral reactivation syndrome.},

	abstract = {Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) are stigmatizing illnesses characterized by cognitive difficulties, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and other symptoms. Patients are often incapacitated and stigmatized as having a psychological disorder. The Chronic Fatigue Attitudes Test (CAT) assesses stigmatizing views toward individuals with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, however, there is little research examining factors that may account for variation in stigmatizing attitudes toward this group. We examined CAT scores among college age research volunteers (N = 90), hypothesizing that exposure to information about ME and CFS as a result of volunteering on a ME and CFS-related research project would be associated with less stigmatizing attitudes compared to volunteers on unrelated projects. Findings indicated that ME and CFS research volunteers expressed less stigmatizing attitudes. Educational efforts aiming to disseminate accurate information about ME and CFS may mitigate stigma and the experience of stigma among individuals with ME and CFS.},

Fatigue (PEM symptoms), Musculoskeletal pain (Pain symptoms), and Neurocognitive disturbances (neurocog symptoms: poor memory, poor concentration) remain high over time.

	abstract = {Objective
Following COVID-19 many patients report persistent fatigue and insomnia. Given the overlapping features, insomnia can be underdiagnosed in post-COVID-19 fatigue patients. This study aimed to determine insomnia severity, prevalence of clinical insomnia and sleep characteristics of post-COVID-19 fatigue patients. Data of post-COVID-19 fatigue patients were compared with those of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a condition resembling post-COVID-19 fatigue.
Methods
In this cross-sectional case-controlled study, insomnia severity, assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and prevalence of clinical insomnia (ISI score ≥ 10), were determined in patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue (n = 114) and compared with ME/CFS (n = 59) using ANCOVA and logistic regression, respectively. Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate whether mood, concentration problems, pain, fatigue (assessed with questionnaires) and diagnosis were associated with insomnia. Sleep characteristics were determined with a sleep diary and accelerometer in post-COVID-19 fatigue and compared with ME/CFS using ANCOVA.
Results
In patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue mean (SD) insomnia severity was 11.46 (5.7) and 64\% reported clinical insomnia. Insomnia severity was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (ß = 0.49, p = 0.006) and age (ß = 0.08, p = 0.04). The mean (SD) subjective sleep duration was 7.4 (1.0) hours with a sleep efficiency of 82 (11)\%. Several subjective sleep characteristics of the post-COVID-19 fatigue patients differed from ME/CFS patients; only sleep duration, being significantly shorter in post-COVID-19 fatigue patients (p = 0.003), seemed clinically relevant (d = 0.58).
Conclusion
Insomnia severity and prevalence of clinical insomnia are high in patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue. Insomnia should be assessed and if present treated with insomnia focused therapy.},

This study aimed to compare flow-mediated dilation values between individuals with long COVID, individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and healthy age-matched controls to assess the potential implications for clinical management and long-term health outcomes.
Methods
A case-case-control approach was employed, and flow-mediated dilation measurements were obtained from 51 participants (17 long COVID patients, 17 ME/CFS patients, and 17 healthy age-matched controls). Flow-mediated dilation values were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance for between-group comparisons.
Results
Results revealed significantly impaired endothelial function in both long COVID and ME/CFS groups compared with healthy age-matched controls as determined by maximum \% brachial artery diameter post-occlusion compared with pre-occlusion resting diameter (6.99 ± 4.33\% and 6.60 ± 3.48\% vs 11.30 ± 4.44\%, respectively, both P {\textless} .05). Notably, there was no difference in flow-mediated dilation between long COVID and ME/CFS groups (P = .949), despite significantly longer illness duration in the ME/CFS group (ME/CFS: 16 ± 11.15 years vs long COVID: 1.36 ± 0.51 years, P {\textless} .0001).
Conclusion
The study demonstrates that both long COVID and ME/CFS patients exhibit similarly impaired endothelial function, indicating potential vascular involvement in the pathogenesis of these post-viral illnesses. The significant reduction in flow-mediated dilation values suggests an increased cardiovascular risk in these populations, warranting careful monitoring and the development of targeted interventions to improve endothelial function and mitigate long-term health implications.},

	abstract = {Background
Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is a core diagnostic criterion in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The majority of ME/CFS patients have no evidence of hypotension or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) during head-up tilt, but do show a significantly larger reduction in stroke volume index (SVI) when upright compared to controls. Theoretically a reduction in SVI should be accompanied by a compensatory increase in heart rate (HR). When there is an incomplete compensatory increase in HR, this is considered chronotropic incompetence. This study explored the relationship between HR and SVI to determine whether chronotropic incompetence was present during tilt testing in ME/CFS patients.
Methods
From a database of individuals who had undergone tilt testing with Doppler measurements for SVI both supine and end-tilt, we selected ME/CFS patients and healthy controls (HC) who had no evidence of POTS or hypotension during the test. To determine the relation between the HR increase and SVI decrease during the tilt test in patients, we calculated the 95\% prediction intervals of this relation in HC. Chronotropic incompetence in patients was defined as a HR increase below the lower limit of the 95th \% prediction interval of the HR increase in HC.
Results
We compared 362 ME/CFS patients with 52 HC. At end-tilt, tilt lasting for 15 (4) min, ME/CFS patients had a significantly lower SVI (22 (4) vs. 27 (4) ml/m2; p {\textless} 0.0001) and a higher HR (87 (11) vs. 78 (15) bpm; p {\textless} 0.0001) compared to HC. There was a similar relationship between HR and SVI between ME/CFS patients and HC in the supine position. During tilt ME/CFS patients had a lower HR for a given SVI; 37\% had an inadequate HR increase. Chronotropic incompetence was more common in more severely affected ME/CFS patients.
Conclusion
These novel findings represent the first description of orthostatic chronotropic incompetence during tilt testing in ME/CFS patients.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Herpesviruses are ubiquitous and after primary infection they establish lifelong latency. The impairment of maintaining latency with short-term or long-term consequences could be triggered by other infection. Therefore, reactivation of herpesviruses in COVID-19 patients represents an emerging issue.
Design and methods
This study provided the first systematic review with meta-analysis of studies that evaluated active human herpesvirus (HHV) infection (defined as the presence of IgM antibodies or HHV-DNA) in COVID-19 patients and included 36 publications collected by searching through PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of science until November 2022.
Results
The prevalence of active EBV, HHV6, HSV, CMV, HSV1, and VZV infection in COVID-19 population was 41\% (95\% CI =27\%-57\%), 3\% (95\% CI=17\%-54\%), 28\% (95\% CI=1\%-85\%), 25\% (95\% CI=1\%-63\%), 22\% (95\% CI=10\%-35\%), and 18\% (95\% CI=4\%-34\%), respectively. There was a 6 times higher chance for active EBV infection in patients with severe COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 controls (OR=6.45, 95\% CI=1.09-38.13, p=0.040), although there was no difference in the prevalence of all evaluated active herpesvirus infections between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 controls.
Conclusions
Future research of herpesvirus and SARS-CoV-2 coinfections must be prioritized to define: who, when and how to be tested, as well as how to effectively treat HHVs reactivations in acute and long COVID-19 patients.},

We show that beyond the first 30 days of illness, people with COVID-19 exhibit a higher risk of death and use of health resources. Our high-dimensional approach identifies incident sequelae in the respiratory system, as well as several other sequelae that include nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain and anaemia. We show increased incident use of several therapeutic agents—including pain medications (opioids and non-opioids) as well as antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihypertensive and oral hypoglycaemic agents—as well as evidence of laboratory abnormalities in several organ systems. Our analysis of an array of prespecified outcomes reveals a risk gradient that increases according to the severity of the acute COVID-19 infection (that is, whether patients were not hospitalized, hospitalized or admitted to intensive care). Our findings show that a substantial burden of health loss that spans pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organ systems is experienced by patients who survive after the acute phase of COVID-19. These results will help to inform health system planning and the development of multidisciplinary care strategies to reduce chronic health loss among individuals with COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background:
Long coronavirus disease 2019 (LC) is a chronic sequel of acute COVID-19. The exact pathophysiology of the affective, chronic fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms (labelled as “physio-affective phenome”) of LC has remained elusive.


Objective:
The current study aims to delineate the effects of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and body temperature during the acute phase on the physio-affective phenome of LC.


Method:
We recruited 120 LC patients and 36 controls. For all participants, we assessed the lowest SpO2 and peak body temperature during acute COVID-19, and the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMD/HAMA) and Fibro Fatigue (FF) scales 3–4 months later.


Results:
Lowered SpO2 and increased body temperature during the acute phase and female sex predict 60.7\% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of LC. Using unsupervised learning techniques, we were able to delineate a new endophenotype class, which comprises around 26.7\% of the LC patients and is characterised by very low SpO2 and very high body temperature, and depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms scores. Single latent vectors could be extracted from both biomarkers, depression, anxiety and FF symptoms or from both biomarkers, insomnia, chronic fatigue, gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms.


Conclusion:
The newly constructed endophenotype class and pathway phenotypes indicate that the physio-affective phenome of LC is at least in part the consequence of the pathophysiology of acute COVID-19, namely the combined effects of lowered SpO2, increased body temperature and the associated immune-inflammatory processes and lung lesions.},

The present study was performed to examine the effects of SpO2 and PBT during acute infection on immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO\&NS) pathways and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID. This study assayed SpO2 and PBT during acute COVID-19, and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in 120 Long COVID individuals and 36 controls. Cluster analysis showed that 31.7\% of the Long COVID patients had severe abnormalities in SpO2, body temperature, increased oxidative toxicity (OSTOX) and lowered antioxidant defenses (ANTIOX), and increased total Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) and Fibromylagia-Fatigue (FF) scores. Around 60\% of the variance in the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID (a factor extracted from HAMD, HAMA and FF scores) was explained by OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio, PBT and SpO2. Increased PBT predicted increased CRP and lowered ANTIOX and zinc levels, while lowered SpO2 predicted lowered Gpx and increased NO production. Lowered SpO2 strongly predicts OSTOX/ANTIOX during Long COVID. In conclusion, the impact of acute COVID-19 on the symptoms of Long COVID is partly mediated by OSTOX/ANTIOX, especially lowered Gpx and zinc, increased MPO and NO production and lipid peroxidation-associated aldehyde formation. The results suggest that post-viral somatic and mental symptoms have a neuroimmune and neuro-oxidative origin.},

Symptoms overlap largely with those of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19/long-COVID implying common pathogenetic mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection is risk factor for sustained latent virus reactivation that may account for the symptoms of post-viral fatigue syndromes. The aim of this study was first to investigate whether patients with ME/CFS and healthy donors (HDs) differed in their antibody response to mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondly, to analyze whether COVID-19 imposes latent virus reactivation in the cohorts.MethodsAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analyzed in plasma and saliva from non-vaccinated ME/CFS (n=95) and HDs (n=110) using soluble multiplex immunoassay. Reactivation of human herpesviruses 1-6 (HSV1, HSV2, VZV, EBV, CMV, HHV6), and human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) was detected by anti-viral antibody fingerprints in saliva.ResultsAt 3-6 months after mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific antibodies in saliva were substantially induced signifying a strong reactivation of latent viruses (EBV, HHV6 and HERV-K) in both cohorts. In patients with ME/CFS, antibody responses were significantly stronger, in particular EBV-encoded nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) IgG were elevated in patients with ME/CFS, but not in HDs. EBV-VCA IgG was also elevated at baseline prior to SARS-infection in patients compared to HDs.ConclusionOur results denote an altered and chronically aroused anti-viral profile against latent viruses in ME/CFS. SARS-CoV-2 infection even in its mild/asymptomatic form is a potent trigger for reactivation of latent herpesviruses (EBV, HHV6) and endogenous retroviruses (HERV-K), as detected by antibody fingerprints locally in the oral mucosa (saliva samples). This has not been shown before because the antibody elevation is not detected systemically in the circulation/plasma.},

The increase in the number of undiagnosed ME/CFS patients became specifically relevant in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this research was to investigate the issues of undiagnosed potential ME/CFS patients, with a hypothetical forecast of the expansion of post-viral CFS as a consequence of COVID-19 and its burden on society. Methods: The theoretical research was founded on the estimation of classic factors presumably affecting the diagnostic scope of ME/CFS and their ascription to Latvian circumstances, as well as a literature review to assess the potential interaction between ME/CFS and COVID-19 as a new contributing agent. The empirical study design consisted of two parts: The first part was dedicated to a comparison of the self-reported data of ME/CFS patients with those of persons experiencing symptoms similar to ME/CFS, but without a diagnosis. This part envisaged the creation of an assumption of the ME/CFS shadow burden “status quo”, not addressing the impact of COVID-19. The second part aimed to investigate data from former COVID-19 patients’ surveys on the presence of ME/CFS symptoms, 6 months after being affected by COVID-19. Descriptive and analytical statistical methods were used to analyse the obtained data. Results: The received data assumed that the previously obtained data on the ME/CFS prevalence of 0.8\% in the Latvian population are appropriate, and the literature review reports a prevalence of 0.2–1.0\% in developed countries. Regarding the reciprocity of ME/CFS and COVID-19, the literature review showed a lack of research in this field. The empirical results show quite similar self-esteem among ME/CFS patients and undiagnosed patients with longstanding disease experience, while former COVID-19 patients show a significantly lower severity of these problems. Notably, “psychological distress (anxiety)” and “episodic fatigue” are significantly predominant symptoms reported by former COVID-19 patients in comparison with ME/CFS patients and undiagnosed patients prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of our analysis predict that the total amount of direct medical costs for undiagnosed patients (out-of-pocket payments) is more than EUR 15 million p.a. (in Latvia), and this may increase by at least 15\% due to the consequences of COVID-19. Conclusions: ME/CFS creates a significant shadow burden on society, even considering only the direct medical costs of undiagnosed patients—the number of whom in Latvia is probably at least five times higher than the number of discerned patients. Simultaneously, COVID-19 can induce long-lasting complications and chronic conditions, such as post-viral CFS, and increase this burden. The Latvian research data assume that ME/CFS patients are not a high-risk group for COVID-19; however, COVID-19 causes ME/CFS-relevant symptoms in patients. This increases the need for monitoring of patients for even longer after recovering from COVID-19′s symptoms, in order to prevent complications and the progression of chronic diseases. In the context of further epidemiological uncertainty, and the possibility of severe post-viral consequences, preventive measures are becoming significantly more important; an integrated diagnostic approach and appropriate treatment could reduce this burden in the future.},

Both the percentage of mice exhibiting reactivated ganglion infection and the viral titers detected in ganglia increased when neurectomized mice were treated with cyclophosphamide. Antithymocyte serum treatment prolonged the time course over which neurectomy-induced virus could be detected, but neither antithymocyte serum nor cyclophosphamide reactivated herpes simplex virus in the absence of neurectomy. These results demonstrate that postganlionic neurectomy provides a specific stimulus for herpes simplex virus reactivation and that cell-mediated immune defense are involved in the highly efficient elimination of reactivated virus from the ganglion in vivo.},

	abstract = {Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex chronic condition affecting multiple body systems, with unknown cause, unclear pathogenesis mechanisms, and fluctuating symptoms which may lead to severe debilitation. It is frequently reported to have been triggered by an infection, but there are no clear differences in exposure to, or seroprevalence of, any particular viruses between people with ME/CFS and healthy individuals. However, herpes viruses have been repeatedly hypothesized to underlie the chronic relapsing/remitting form of MS/CFS due to their persistence in a latent form with periodic reactivation. It is possible that ME/CFS is associated with herpes virus reactivation, which has not been detectable previously due to insufficiently sensitive testing methods. Saliva samples were collected from 30 people living with ME/CFS at monthly intervals for 6 months and at times when they experienced symptom exacerbation, as well as from 14 healthy control individuals. The viral DNA load of the nine humanherpes viruses was determined by digital droplet PCR. Symptoms were assessed by questionnaire at each time point. Human herpesvirus (HHV) 6B, HHV-7, herpes simplex virus 1 and Epstein-Barr virus were detectable within the saliva samples, with higher HHV-6B and HHV-7 viral loads detected in people with ME/CFS than in healthy controls. Participants with ME/CFS could be broadly separated into two groups: one group displayed fluctuating patterns of herpesviruses detectable across the 6 months while the second group displayed more stable viral presentation. In the first group, there was positive correlation between HHV-6B and HHV-7 viral load and severity of symptom scores, including pain, neurocognition, and autonomic dysfunction. The results indicate that fluctuating viral DNA load correlates with ME/CFS symptoms: this is in accordance with the hypothesis that pathogenesis is related to herpesvirus reactivation state, and this should be formally tested. Herpesvirus reactivation might be a cause or consequence of dysregulated immune function seen in ME/CFS. The sampling strategy and molecular tools developed here permit such large-scale epidemiological investigations.},

The role of DCs as mediators of resistance to HSV-1 infection was investigated using CD11c-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice, in which DCs can be transiently depleted in vivo by treatment with low doses of DT. We show that ablation of DCs led to enhanced susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in the highly resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain. Specifically, we showed that the depletion of DCs led to increased viral spread into the nervous system, resulting in an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, we showed that ablation of DCs impaired the optimal activation of NK cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to HSV-1. These data demonstrated that DCs were essential not only in the optimal activation of the acquired T-cell response to HSV-1 but also that DCs were crucial for innate resistance to HSV-1 infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is an etiologically unexplained disorder characterised by irregularities in various aspects of the immunological function. Presently, it is unknown whether these immunological changes remain consistent over time. This study investigates Natural Killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity, NK cell subsets (CD56brightCD16- and CD56dimCD16+) and cytokines, over the course of a12 month period in patients with CFS/ME.
METHODS: The participants in the study comprised 65 (47.2 ± 11.5 years) CFS/ME participants and 21 (45.2 ± 9.3 years) non-fatigued controls. Flow cytometry protocols were used to assess NK subsets and NK cytotoxic activity at various time points that included baseline (T1), 6 (T2) and 12 months (T3). Cytokine secretions were measured following mitogenic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
RESULTS: NK cytotoxic activity was significantly decreased in the CFS/ME patients at T1, T2 and T3 compared to the non-fatigued group. Additionally, in comparison to the non-fatigued controls, the CFS/ME group had significantly lower numbers of CD56brightCD16- NK cells at both T1 and T2. Interestingly, following mitogenic stimulation, cytokine secretion revealed significant increases in IL-10, IFN-γ and TNF-α at T1 in the CFS/ME group. A significant decrease was observed at T2 in the CFS/ME group for IL-10 and IL-17A while at T3, IL-2 was increased in the CFS/ME group in comparison to the non-fatigued controls. Overall cytotoxic activity was significantly decreased at T3 compared to T1 and T2. CD56brightCD16- NK cells were much lower at T2 compared to T1 and T3. IL-10 and IL-17A secretion was elevated at T2 in comparison to T1 and T3.
CONCLUSION: These results confirm decreases in immune function in CFS/ME patients, suggesting an increased susceptibility to viral and other infections. Furthermore, NK cytotoxic activity may be a suitable biomarker for diagnosing CFS/ME as it was consistently decreased during the course of the 12 months study.},

	abstract = {Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is able to establish latency in infected individuals. In order to characterize potential new immune-escape mechanisms, mature dendritic cells (DCs) were infected with HSV-1 and total cellular RNA was isolated from infected and mock-infected populations at different time points. RNA profiling on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A arrays demonstrated a dramatic downregulation of the migration-mediating surface molecules CCR7 and CXCR4, an observation that was further confirmed by RT-PCR and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses. Furthermore, migration assays revealed that, upon infection of mature DCs, CCR7- and CXCR4-mediated migration towards the corresponding CCL19 and CXCL12 chemokine gradients was strongly reduced. It is noteworthy that the infection of immature DCs with HSV-1 prior to maturation led to a failure of CCR7 and CXCR4 upregulation during DC maturation and, as a consequence, also induced a block in their migratory capacity. Additional migration assays with a Δvhs mutant virus lacking the virion host shutoff (vhs) gene, which is known to degrade cellular mRNAs, suggested a vhs-independent mechanism. These results indicate that HSV-1-infected mature DCs are limited in their capacity to migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, the areas of antigen presentation and T-cell stimulation, thus inhibiting an antiviral immune response. This represents a novel, previously unrecognized mechanism for HSV-1 to escape the human immune system.},

It is frequently associated with psychosocial factors, such as depression, sleep disorder, anxiety, and coping style, which suggest that dysregulation of the body's stress systems may serve as an underlying mechanism in the maintenance of chronic fatigue (CF). This article addresses the endocrine, neural, and immune factors that contribute to fatigue and describes research regarding the role of these factors in chronic fatigue syndrome as a model for addressing the biology of CF. In general, hypoactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system alterations characterized by sympathetic overactivity and low vagal tone, as well as immune abnormalities, may contribute to the expression of CF. Noninvasive methods for evaluating endocrine, neural, and immune function are also discussed. Simultaneous evaluation of neuroendocrine and immune systems with noninvasive techniques will help elucidate the underlying interactions of these systems, their role in disease susceptibility, and progression of stress-related disorders.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical symptoms and response evoked by upright tilt-table testing in healthy individuals and in a sample of those satisfying strict criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome.
DESIGN: Case-comparison study with mean (SD) follow-up of 24 (5) weeks.
SETTING: Tertiary care hospital.
PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 23 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (five men and 18 women; mean age, 34 years), each of whom fulfilled the strict diagnostic criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was recruited from regional chronic fatigue support groups and from the investigators' clinical practices. There were 14 healthy controls (four men and 10 women; mean age, 36 years).
INTERVENTIONS: Each subject completed a symptom questionnaire and underwent a three-stage upright tilt-table test (stage 1, 45 minutes at 70 degrees tilt; stage 2, 15 minutes at 70 degrees tilt with 1 to 2 micrograms/min of isoproterenol; and stage 3, 10 minutes at 70 degrees with 3 to 4 micrograms/min of isoproterenol). Patients were offered therapy with fludrocortisone, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and disopyramide, alone or in combination, directed at neurally mediated hypotension.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to upright tilt and scores on symptom questionnaires prior to and during follow-up.
RESULTS: An abnormal response to upright tilt was observed in 22 of 23 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome vs four of 14 controls (P {\textless} .001). Seventy percent of chronic fatigue syndrome patients, but no controls, had an abnormal response during stage 1 (P {\textless} .001). Nine patients reported complete or nearly complete resolution of chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms after therapy directed at neurally mediated hypotension.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that chronic fatigue syndrome is associated with neurally mediated hypotension and that its symptoms may be improved in a subset of patients by therapy directed at this abnormal cardiovascular reflex.},

	abstract = {The study examined whether deficits in cardiac output and blood volume in a CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) cohort were present and linked to illness severity and sedentary lifestyle. Follow-up analyses assessed whether differences in cardiac output levels between CFS and control groups were corrected by controlling for cardiac contractility and TBV (total blood volume). The 146 participants were subdivided into two CFS groups based on symptom severity data, severe (n=30) and non-severe (n=26), and two healthy non-CFS control groups based on physical activity, sedentary (n=58) and non-sedentary (n=32). Controls were matched to CFS participants using age, gender, ethnicity and body mass. Echocardiographic measures indicated that the severe CFS participants had 10.2\% lower cardiac volume (i.e. stroke index and end-diastolic volume) and 25.1\% lower contractility (velocity of circumferential shortening corrected by heart rate) than the control groups. Dual tag blood volume assessments indicated that the CFS groups had lower TBV, PV (plasma volume) and RBCV (red blood cell volume) than control groups. Of the CFS subjects with a TBV deficit (i.e. {\textgreater} or = 8\% below ideal levels), the mean+/-S.D. percentage deficit in TBV, PV and RBCV were -15.4+/-4.0, -13.2+/-5.0 and -19.1+/-6.3\% respectively. Lower cardiac volume levels in CFS were substantially corrected by controlling for prevailing TBV deficits, but were not affected by controlling for cardiac contractility levels. Analyses indicated that the TBV deficit explained 91-94\% of the group differences in cardiac volume indices. Group differences in cardiac structure were offsetting and, hence, no differences emerged for left ventricular mass index. Therefore the findings indicate that lower cardiac volume levels, displayed primarily by subjects with severe CFS, were not linked to diminished cardiac contractility levels, but were probably a consequence of a co-morbid hypovolaemic condition. Further study is needed to address the extent to which the cardiac and blood volume alterations in CFS have physiological and clinical significance.},

	abstract = {Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a complex illness affecting 4 million Americans for which no characteristic lesion has been identified. Instead of searching for a deficiency in any single marker, we propose that CFS is associated with a profound imbalance in the regulation of immune function forcing a departure from standard pre-programmed responses. To identify these imbalances we apply network analysis to the co-expression of 16 cytokines in CFS subjects and healthy controls. Concentrations of IL-1a, 1b, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17 and 23, IFN-γ, lymphotoxin-α (LT-α) and TNF-α were measured in the plasma of 40 female CFS and 59 case-matched controls. Cytokine co-expression networks were constructed from the pair-wise mutual information (MI) patterns found within each subject group. These networks differed in topology significantly more than expected by chance with the CFS network being more hub-like in design. Analysis of local modularity isolated statistically distinct cytokine communities recognizable as pre-programmed immune functional components. These showed highly attenuated Th1 and Th17 immune responses in CFS. High Th2 marker expression but weak interaction patterns pointed to an established Th2 inflammatory milieu. Similarly, altered associations in CFS provided indirect evidence of diminished NK cell responsiveness to IL-12 and LT-α stimulus. These observations are consistent with several processes active in latent viral infection and would not have been uncovered by assessing marker expression alone. Furthermore this analysis identifies key sub-networks such as IL-2:IFN-γ:TNF-α that might be targeted in restoring normal immune function.},

	abstract = {Many chronic diseases are associated with both fatigue and disrupted or nonrestorative sleep. In addition, so-called ‘sickness behaviors’ (for example, anorexia, anhedonia, reduced social interaction, fatigue) are common during infectious and inflammatory disease and have been linked to facets of the immune response. To study these relationships, we used murine gammaherpesvirus (MuGHV), a natural pathogen of wild rodents that provides an experimental model for studying the pathophysiology of an Epstein-Barr (EBV)-like γ-herpesvirus infection in mice. We exposed male and female C57BL/6J mice that were either uninfected or latently infected with MuGHV to either sleep fragmentation (SF) or control conditions and measured the effects on behavior and markers of inflammation. Exposure of infected male mice to SF during the normal somnolent (light) phase significantly reduced locomotor activity during the subsequent active phase, despite an intervening 6-h rest period. Infection was associated with significant increases in lung IFNγ and CXC motif ligand (CXCL) 10 in both male and female mice. In both infected and uninfected male mice, exposure to SF was associated with lower levels of IL1β and C-C motif ligand (CCL) 3 in lung. Exposure of infected female mice to SF led to reductions in lung IL2, CXCL1, and CCL 3. Thus, compared with control conditions, SF was generally associated with lower concentrations of various cytokines in lung. These findings, together with our previous work, indicate that complex interactions among several host factors likely contribute to the behavioral and inflammatory changes associated with viral infection and sleep disruption even in a well-controlled mouse model.},

The diagnosis of this disease is difficult, due to lacking a proper and suited diagnostic laboratory test, besides to its multifaceted symptoms. Numerous factors, including environmental and immunological issues, and a large spectrum of CFS symptoms, have recently been reported. In this review, we focus on the nutritional intervention in CFS, discussing the many immunological, environmental, and nutritional aspects currently investigated about this disease. Changes in immunoglobulin levels, cytokine proﬁles and B- and T- cell phenotype and declined cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, are commonly reported features of immune dysregulation in CFS. Also, some nutrient deficiencies (vitamin C, vitamin B complex, sodium, magnesium, zinc, folic acid, l-carnitine, l-tryptophan, essential fatty acids, and coenzyme Q10) appear to be important in the severity and exacerbation of CFS symptoms.

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Symptoms and hemodynamic findings during orthostatic stress have been reported in both long-haul COVID-19 and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), but little work has directly compared patients from these two groups. To investigate the overlap in these clinical phenotypes, we compared orthostatic symptoms in daily life and during head-up tilt, heart rate and blood pressure responses to tilt, and reductions in cerebral blood flow in response to orthostatic stress in long-haul COVID-19 patients, ME/CFS controls, and healthy controls. Materials and Methods: We compared 10 consecutive long-haul COVID-19 cases with 20 age- and gender-matched ME/CFS controls with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) during head-up tilt, 20 age- and gender-matched ME/CFS controls with a normal heart rate and blood pressure response to head-up tilt, and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Identical symptom questionnaires and tilt test procedures were used for all groups, including measurement of cerebral blood flow and cardiac index during the orthostatic stress. Results: There were no significant differences in ME/CFS symptom prevalence between the long-haul COVID-19 patients and the ME/CFS patients. All long-haul COVID-19 patients developed POTS during tilt. Cerebral blood flow and cardiac index were more significantly reduced in the three patient groups compared with the healthy controls. Cardiac index reduction was not different between the three patient groups. The cerebral blood flow reduction was larger in the long-haul COVID-19 patients compared with the ME/CFS patients with a normal heart rate and blood pressure response. Conclusions: The symptoms of long-haul COVID-19 are similar to those of ME/CFS patients, as is the response to tilt testing. Cerebral blood flow and cardiac index reductions during tilt were more severely impaired than in many patients with ME/CFS. The finding of early-onset orthostatic intolerance symptoms, and the high pre-illness physical activity level of the long-haul COVID-19 patients, makes it unlikely that POTS in this group is due to deconditioning. These data suggest that similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 infection acts as a trigger for the development of ME/CFS.},

Reanalysis of data from a study by Jason comparing symptom reports from two groups of ME/CFS and PASC patients shows a notably similar symptomatology. Symptom scores of the PASC group and the ME/CFS group correlated 0.902 (p {\textless} 0.0001) across items. The hypothesis is presented that ME/CFS and PASC are caused by a chronic state of multisystemic disequilibrium including endocrinological, immunological, and/or metabolic changes. The hypothesis holds that a changed set point persistently pushes the organism towards a pathological dysfunctional state which fails to reset. To use an analogy of a thermostat, if the ‘off switch’ of a thermostat intermittently stops working, for periods the house would become warmer and warmer without limit. The hypothesis draws on recent investigations of the Central Homeostasis Network showing multiple interconnections between the autonomic system, central nervous system, and brain stem. The hypothesis helps to explain the shared symptomatology of ME/CFS and PASC and the unpredictable, intermittent, and fluctuating pattern of symptoms of ME/CFS and PASC. The current theoretical approach remains speculative and requires in-depth investigation before any definite conclusions can be drawn.},

We measured serum IgA/IgM/IgG against HHV-6 and EBV and their deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (duTPase), SARS-CoV-2, and activin-A, C-reactive protein (CRP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR).Results Long COVID patients showed significant elevations in IgG/IgM-SARS-CoV-2, IgG/IgM-HHV-6 and HHV-6-duTPase, IgA/IgM-activin-A, CRP, AOPP, and HOMA2-IR. Neural network analysis yielded a highly significant predictive accuracy of 80.6\% for the Long COVID diagnosis (sensitivity: 78.9\%, specificity: 81.8\%, area under the ROC curve=0.876); the topmost predictors were: IGA-activin-A, IgG-HHV-6, IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-SARS-CoV-2, and IgM-HHV-6 (all positively) and a factor extracted from all IgA levels to all viral antigens (inversely). The top-5 predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID were: IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-HHV-6, CRP, education, IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy of r=0.636). The top-5 predictors of CFS due to Long COVID were in descending order: CRP, IgG-HHV-6-duTPase, IgM-activin-A, IgM-SARS-CoV-2, and IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy: r=0.709).Conclusion Reactivation of HHV-6, SARS-CoV-2 persistence, and autoimmune reactions to activin-A combined with activated immune-oxidative pathways play a major role in the pathophysiology of Long COVID as well as the severity of affective symptoms and CFS due to Long COVID.},

	abstract = {Long COVID occurs in those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) whose symptoms persist or develop beyond the acute phase. We conducted a systematic review to determine the prevalence of persistent symptoms, functional disability, or pathological changes in adults or children at least 12 weeks postinfection.We searched key registers and databases from January 1, 2020 to November 2, 2021, limited to publications in English and studies with at least 100 participants. Studies in which all participants were critically ill were excluded. Long COVID was extracted as prevalence of at least 1 symptom or pathology, or prevalence of the most common symptom or pathology, at 12 weeks or later. Heterogeneity was quantified in absolute terms and as a proportion of total variation and explored across predefined subgroups (PROSPERO ID CRD42020218351).One hundred twenty studies in 130 publications were included. Length of follow-up varied between 12 weeks and 12 months. Few studies had low risk of bias. All complete and subgroup analyses except 1 had I2 ≥90\%, with prevalence of persistent symptoms range of 0\%–93\% (pooled estimate [PE], 42.1\%; 95\% prediction interval [PI], 6.8\% to 87.9\%). Studies using routine healthcare records tended to report lower prevalence (PE, 13.6\%; PI, 1.2\% to 68\%) of persistent symptoms/pathology than self-report (PE, 43.9\%; PI, 8.2\% to 87.2\%). However, studies systematically investigating pathology in all participants at follow up tended to report the highest estimates of all 3 (PE, 51.7\%; PI, 12.3\% to 89.1\%). Studies of hospitalized cases had generally higher estimates than community-based studies.The way in which Long COVID is defined and measured affects prevalence estimation. Given the widespread nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally, the burden of chronic illness is likely to be substantial even using the most conservative estimates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is considered a hallmark characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). This may also apply to subgroups of patients with long COVID-induced ME/CFS. However, it is uncertain to what extent PEM is acknowledged in routine specialist healthcare for ME/CFS patients, and how this affects patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate to what extent ME/CFS patients experienced focus on PEM in specialist healthcare practice and its significance for outcome and care quality.
METHODS: Data from two online cross-sectional surveys covering specialist healthcare services for ME/CFS patients at rehabilitation institutes in Norway and two regional hospitals, respectively, were analyzed. Evaluations of 788 rehabilitation stays, 86 hospital consultations, and 89 hospital interventions were included. Logistic regression models and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to quantify the impact of addressing PEM on health and functioning, care satisfaction, or benefit. Spearman's rank correlation and Cronbach's alpha of focus on PEM with the respondents' perception of healthcare providers' knowledge, symptom acknowledgment, and suitability of intervention were assessed as measures for care quality and their internal consistency, respectively.
RESULTS: PEM was addressed in 48\% of the rehabilitation stays, 43\% of the consultations, and 65\% of the hospital interventions. Failure to address PEM roughly doubled the risk of health deterioration, following rehabilitation (OR = 0.39, 95\% CI 0.29-0.52; 40.1\% vs. 63.2\% P = {\textless}0.001) and hospital intervention (OR = 0.34, 95\% CI 0.13-0.89; 22.4\% vs. 45.2\%, p = 0.026). The focus on PEM (PEM-focus) during the clinical contact was associated with significantly higher scores on patients' rated care satisfaction and benefit of both consultation and intervention. Furthermore, addressing PEM was (inter)related to positive views about healthcare providers' level of knowledge of ME/CFS, their acknowledgment of symptoms, obtained knowledge, and the perceived suitability of intervention (Cronbach's alpha ≥0.80).
DISCUSSION: PEM is still frequently not acknowledged in specialist healthcare practice for ME/CFS patients in Norway. Not addressing PEM substantially increased the probability of a decline in health and functioning following the intervention and was strongly associated with reduced perceived care quality, satisfaction, and benefit. These findings may be related to the applied explanatory models for ME/CFS and are most likely of relevance to long COVID.},

This study aims to evaluate the pathological role of neuroinflammation in ME/CFS by conducting an exhaustive analysis of 65 observational studies. Four neuroimaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET), were employed to comparatively assess brain regional structure, metabolite profiles, electrical activity, and glial activity in 1529 ME/CFS patients (277 males, 1252 females) and 1715 controls (469 males, 1246 females). Clinical characteristics, including sex, age, and fatigue severity, were consistent with established epidemiological patterns. Regional alterations were most frequently identified in the cerebral cortex, with a notable focus on the frontal cortex. However, our meta-analysis data revealed a significant hypoactivity in the insular and thalamic regions, contrary to observed frequencies. These abnormalities, occurring in pivotal network hubs bridging reason and emotion, disrupt connections with the limbic system, contributing to the hallmark symptoms of ME/CFS. Furthermore, we discuss the regions where neuroinflammatory features are frequently observed and address critical neuroimaging limitations, including issues related to inter-rater reliability. This systematic review serves as a valuable guide for defining regions of interest (ROI) in future neuroimaging investigations of ME/CFS.},

	abstract = {Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway (KP) is believed to play a significant role in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders. While some evidence links the KP to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), further studies are needed to clarify the overall picture of how inflammation-driven KP disturbances may contribute to symptomology in ME/CFS. Here, we report that plasma levels of most bioactive KP metabolites differed significantly between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls in a manner consistent with their known contribution to symptomology in other neurological disorders. Importantly, we found that enhanced production of the first KP metabolite, kynurenine (KYN), correlated with symptom severity, highlighting the relationship between inflammation, KP dysregulation, and ME/CFS symptomology. Other significant changes in the KP included lower levels of the downstream KP metabolites 3-HK, 3-HAA, QUIN, and PIC that could negatively impact cellular energetics. We also rationalized KP dysregulation to changes in the expression of inflammatory cytokines and, for the first time, assessed levels of the iron (Fe)-regulating hormone hepcidin that is also inflammation-responsive. Levels of hepcidin in ME/CFS decreased nearly by half, which might reflect systemic low Fe levels or possibly ongoing hypoxia. We next performed a proteomics screen to survey for other significant differences in protein expression in ME/CFS. Interestingly, out of the seven most significantly modulated proteins in ME/CFS patient plasma, 5 proteins have roles in maintaining gut health, which considering the new appreciation of how gut microbiome and health modulates systemic KP could highlight a new explanation of symptomology in ME/CFS patients and potential new prognostic biomarker/s and/or treatment avenues.},

Patients completed an online retrospective cost diary, providing ME/CFS-related direct medical, non-medical and indirect costs. Informal care costs were collected directly from carers. Data from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Medicare Benefits Schedule were linked to participant survey data. Annual per patient and total societal costs were estimated, broken down by category and presented in 2021 AUD. Factors associated with higher costs were investigated using generalised linear models.Results One hundred and seventy five patients (mean age 49years s.d. 14, 79.4\% female) completed the cost diary. Estimated total annual societal costs of ME/CFS in Australia ranged between \$1.38 and \$10.09 billion, with average annual total costs of \$63400/patient. Three-quarters of these costs were due to indirect costs (\$46731). Disability severity was the key factor associated with higher costs, particularly for indirect costs (being 2.27-fold higher for severe disability than no/mild disability).Conclusions ME/CFS poses a significant economic burden in Australia, owing mainly to high indirect and informal care costs.},

The aim of this study was to describe sociodemographic and illness characteristics of Australian patients with CFS/ME.Methods: A cross-sectional survey on the medical history of patients enrolled in an Australian CFS/ME research database between April 2013 and April 2015. Participants were classified according to Fukuda criteria and International Consensus Criteria.Results: A total of 535 patients diagnosed with CFS/ME by a primary care physician were identified. The mean age of all patients was 46.4 years (standard deviation 12.0); the majority were female (78.61\%), Caucasian, and highly educated. Of these, 30.28\% met Fukuda criteria. A further 31.96\% met both Fukuda criteria and International Consensus Criteria. There were 14.58\% reporting chronic fatigue but did not meet criteria for CFS/ME and 23.18\% were considered noncases due to exclusionary conditions. Within those meeting CFS/ME criteria, the most common events prior to illness included cold or flu, gastrointestinal illness, and periods of undue stress. Of the 60 symptoms surveyed, fatigue, cognitive, and short-term memory symptoms, headaches, muscle and joint pain, unrefreshed sleep, sensory disturbances, muscle weakness, and intolerance to extremes of temperature were the most commonly occurring symptoms (reported by more than two-thirds of patients). Significant differences in symptom occurrence between Fukuda- and International Consensus Criteria-defined cases were also identified.Conclusion: This is the first study to summarize sociodemographic and illness characteristics of a cohort of Australian CFS/ME patients. This is vital for identifying potential risk factors and predictors associated with CFS/ME and for guiding decisions regarding health care provision, diagnosis, and management.

Here we identify a metallopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)3,4, isolated from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-permissive Vero E6 cells, that efficiently binds the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein. We found that a soluble form of ACE2, but not of the related enzyme ACE1, blocked association of the S1 domain with Vero E6 cells. 293T cells transfected with ACE2, but not those transfected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 receptors, formed multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing S protein. Furthermore, SARS-CoV replicated efficiently on ACE2-transfected but not mock-transfected 293T cells. Finally, anti-ACE2 but not anti-ACE1 antibody blocked viral replication on Vero E6 cells. Together our data indicate that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route. A distinct coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain). The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS-CoV. This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Pulmonary involvement is the dominant clinical feature but extra-pulmonary manifestations are also common. Factors that account for the wide spectrum of organ system involvement and disease severity are poorly understood and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection remains unclear. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as the functional cellular receptor for SARS-CoV. Studies of the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV, and ACE2 protein expression, reveal new insights into the pathogenesis of this deadly disease. ACE2 is expressed at high level in the primary target cells of SARS-CoV, namely pneumocytes and surface enterocytes of the small intestine. Despite the fact that SARS-CoV can infect the lung and intestine, the tissue responses in these two organs are different. All other tissues and cell types expressing ACE2 may be potential targets of SARS-CoV infection. Remarkably, endothelial cells, which express ACE2 to a high level, have not been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV. There is also evidence that cell types without detectable ACE2 expression may also be infected by the virus. Furthermore, studies in a new human cell culture model have indicated that the presence of ACE2 alone is not sufficient for maintaining viral infection. Therefore, other virus receptors or co-receptors may be required in different tissues. Moreover, the interaction between SARS-CoV and the immunological or lymphoid system remains to be defined. It is clear that we are only at the dawn of our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS. As our knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms improves, a more rational approach to therapeutic and vaccine development can be designed in order to combat this new and fatal human disease.

	abstract = {Background Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is accelerating worldwide, and novel clinical presentations of COVID-19 are often reported. The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19. Methods We performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), and CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status. Results ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA andPPIB), CD26 (DPP4), and related molecules were expressed in both epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL, or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. Conclusions Our data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors related to age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status, might contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.},

The aim of the study was to analyse the expression and activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 1 (ACE1) and ACE2 in human monocytes (MO) and their subsets. The highest relative level of ACE1-, as well as ACE2-mRNA expression, was observed in CD14++CD16− (classical) MO. Moreover, in these cells, mean level of ACE2-mRNA was almost two times higher than that of ACE1-mRNA (11.48 versus 7.073 relative units, respectively). In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), MO and classical MO, ACE1 and ACE2 protein expression was stronger compared to other MO subpopulations. The highest level of Ang II generated from Ang I in vitro was observed in classical MO. In this setting, generation of Ang-(1–9) by PBMC and classical MO was higher when compared to the whole MO population (P \&lt; 0·05). The generation rate of vasoprotective Ang-(1–7) was comparable in all analysed cell populations. However, in CD14+CD16++ (non-classical) MO, formation of Ang-(1–7) was significantly greater than Ang II (P \&lt; 0·001). We suggest that in physiological conditions MO (but also lymphocytes forming the rest of PBMC pool) may be involved in the regulation of vessel wall homeostasis via the RAAS-related mechanisms. Moreover, non-classical MO, which are associated preferentially with the vascular endothelium, express the vasoprotective phenotype.},

Based on its excellent AChE inhibition effect and its lowest cytotoxicity, Schisandra chinensis (SC) extract was selected to do the mechanism research. SC extract protected pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells against H2O2-induced toxicity by improving the cell survival rate in a dose-dependent manner. And it also showed significant free radical (DPPH) scavenging activities, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2′-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging. To confirm these results, the scopolamine-induced mice models were utilized in this study. Compared with the positive drug (piracetam), SC could also exhibit similar effects to alleviate the mice’s cognitive deficits. Moreover, in the mice brain samples, the AChE activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of SC-treatment group both showed a reverse as compared to model group.

There was no ACE2 expression on platelets and very low level of ACE2 protein expression on the surface of human primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. The ACE2 expression was markedly upregulated on the activated type 1 macrophages (M1). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated high expressions of ACE2 on human tissue macrophages, such as alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells within livers, and microglial cells in brain at steady state.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A novel human zinc metalloprotease that has considerable homology to human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (40\% identity and 61\% similarity) has been identified. This metalloprotease (angiotensin-converting enzyme homolog (ACEH)) contains a single HE\textit{XX}H zinc-binding domain and conserves other critical residues typical of the ACE family. The predicted protein sequence consists of 805 amino acids, including a potential 17-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide sequence and a putative C-terminal membrane anchor. Expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells of a soluble, truncated form of ACEH, lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains, produces a glycoprotein of 120 kDa, which is able to cleave angiotensin I and angiotensin II but not bradykinin or Hip-His-Leu. In the hydrolysis of the angiotensins, ACEH functions exclusively as a carboxypeptidase. ACEH activity is inhibited by EDTA but not by classical ACE inhibitors such as captopril, lisinopril, or enalaprilat. Identification of the genomic sequence of ACEH has shown that the ACEH gene contains 18 exons, of which several have considerable size similarity with the first 17 exons of human ACE. The gene maps to chromosomal location Xp22. Northern blotting analysis has shown that the ACEH mRNA transcript is ∼3.4 kilobase pairs and is most highly expressed in testis, kidney, and heart. This is the first report of a mammalian homolog of ACE and has implications for our understanding of cardiovascular and renal function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Insulin-like growth factor-1, angiotensin-(1–7) and angiotensin-(1–9) have been proposed to be important mediators in cardioprotection. A large body of evidence indicates that insulin like growth factor-1 has pleotropic actions in the heart (i.e., contractility, metabolism, hypertrophy, autophagy, senescence and cell death) and, conversely, its deficiency is associated with impaired cardiac function. Recently, we reported that insulin like growth factor-1 receptor is also located in plasma membrane invaginations with perinuclear localization, highlighting the role of nuclear Ca2+ signaling in the heart. In parallel, angiotensin-(1–7) and angiotensin (1–9) acting through Mas receptor and angiotensin type 2 receptor have emerged as a novel anti-hypertensive molecules promoting vasodilatation and preventing heart hypertrophy. In this review we discuss the scientific evidence available regarding insulin-like growth factor-1, angiotensin-(1–7) and angiotensin-(1–9) in cardioprotection and its potential application as novel therapeutic targets for treating cardiac diseases.},

	abstract = {Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 can result in severe respiratory complications and death. Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specifically, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NFκB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex condition involving multiple organ systems and characterized by persistent/relapsing debilitating fatigue, immune dysfunction, neurological problems, and other symptoms not curable for at least 6 months. Disruption of DNA methylation patterns has been tied to various immune and neurological diseases; however, its status in ME/CFS remains uncertain. Our study aimed at identifying changes in the DNA methylation patterns that associate with ME/CFS. Methods We extracted genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 ME/CFS study subjects and 12 healthy controls and measured global DNA methylation by ELISA-like method and site-specific methylation status using Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays. Pyrosequencing validation included 33 ME/CFS cases and 31 controls from two geographically distant cohorts. Results Global DNA methylation levels of ME/CFS cases were similar to those of controls. However, microarray-based approach allowed detection of 17,296 differentially methylated CpG sites in 6,368 genes across regulatory elements and within coding regions of genes. Analysis of DNA methylation in promoter regions revealed 307 differentially methylated promoters. Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that genes associated with differentially methylated promoters participated in at least 15 different pathways mostly related to cell signaling with a strong immune component. Conclusions This is the first study that has explored genome-wide epigenetic changes associated with ME/CFS using the advanced Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays covering about 850,000 CpG sites in two geographically distant cohorts of ME/CFS cases and matched controls. Our results are aligned with previous studies that indicate a dysregulation of the immune system in ME/CFS. They also suggest a potential role of epigenetic de-regulation in the pathobiology of ME/CFS. We propose screening of larger cohorts of ME/CFS cases to determine the external validity of these epigenetic changes in order to implement them as possible diagnostic markers in clinical setting.},

We found that the expression of genes that play key roles in mitochondrial function and oxidative balance, including superoxide dismutase 2, were altered, as were genes involved in energy production, muscular trophism and fiber phenotype determination. Importantly, the expression of a gene encoding a component of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor binding site was reduced, suggesting impaired neuromuscular transmission.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several infections trigger postinfective fatigue syndromes, which share key illness characteristics with each other and with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Previous cross-sectional case-control studies of CFS have suggested that unique gene expression signatures are evident in peripheral blood samples.
METHODS: Peripheral blood transcriptomes in samples collected longitudinally, in 18 subjects with a fatigue syndrome lasting ≥ 6 months after acute infection due to Epstein-Barr virus, Ross River virus, or Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), and 18 matched control subjects who had recovered promptly, were studied by microarray (n = 127) and confirmatory quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Gene expression patterns associated with CFS were sought by univariate statistics and regression modeling.
RESULTS: There were 23 genes with modest differential expression (0.6-2.3-fold change) in within-subject comparisons of early, symptomatic time points with late, recovered time points. There were modest differences found in 63 genes, either in cross-sectional comparison of cases and controls at 6 months after infection onset or in the regression model. There were 223 genes significantly correlated with individual symptom domains. Quantitative PCR confirmed 33 (73\%) of 45 genes-none were consistent across cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the illness characteristics of patients with postinfective fatigue syndromes have more similarities than differences, no reliable peripheral blood gene expression correlate is evident.},

Total RNA from PBMCs of five CFS cases and seventeen controls was labeled and hybridized to 1764 genes on filter arrays. Gene intensity values were analyzed by various classification algorithms and nonparametric statistical methods. The classification algorithms grouped the majority of the CFS cases together, and distinguished them from the healthy controls. Eight genes were differentially expressed in both an age-matched case-control analysis and when comparing all CFS cases to all controls. Several of the diffrentially expressed genes are associated with immunologic functions (e.g., CMRF35 antigen, IL-8, HD protein) and implicate immune dysfunction in the pathophysiology of CFS.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a prevalent and disabling condition affecting adolescents. The pathophysiology is poorly understood, but immune alterations might be an important component. This study compared whole blood gene expression in adolescent CFS patients and healthy controls, and explored associations between gene expression and neuroendocrine markers, immune markers and clinical markers within the CFS group.
METHODS: CFS patients (12-18 years old) were recruited nation-wide to a single referral center as part of the NorCAPITAL project. A broad case definition of CFS was applied, requiring 3 months of unexplained, disabling chronic/relapsing fatigue of new onset, whereas no accompanying symptoms were necessary. Healthy controls having comparable distribution of gender and age were recruited from local schools. Whole blood samples were subjected to RNA sequencing. Immune markers were blood leukocyte counts, plasma cytokines, serum C-reactive protein and immunoglobulins. Neuroendocrine markers encompassed plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and cortisol, as well as heart rate variability indices. Clinical markers consisted of questionnaire scores for symptoms of post-exertional malaise, inflammation, fatigue, depression and trait anxiety, as well as activity recordings.
RESULTS: A total of 29 CFS patients and 18 healthy controls were included. We identified 176 genes as differentially expressed in patients compared to controls, adjusting for age and gender factors. Gene set enrichment analyses suggested impairment of B cell differentiation and survival, as well as enhancement of innate antiviral responses and inflammation in the CFS group. A pattern of co-expression could be identified, and this pattern, as well as single gene transcripts, was significantly associated with indices of autonomic nervous activity, plasma cortisol, and blood monocyte and eosinophil counts. Also, an association with symptoms of post-exertional malaise was demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: Adolescent CFS is characterized by differential gene expression pattern in whole blood suggestive of impaired B cell differentiation and survival, and enhanced innate antiviral responses and inflammation. This expression pattern is associated with neuroendocrine markers of altered HPA axis and autonomic nervous activity, and with symptoms of post-exertional malaise.

Twenty-seven gene transcripts were increased 1.5- to sixfold and six decreased three- to sixfold in the patient group ( P {\textless} 0.01). The top enhanced gene transcripts, IL8, NFΚBIA and TNFAIP3, are functionally related to inflammation, and significant changes were validated for IL8 and NFΚBIA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Functional network analysis of the altered gene transcripts ( P {\textless} 0.01) detected interactions between the products related to inflammation, circadian clock function, metabolic dysregulation, cellular stress responses and mitochondrial function. Ingenuity pathway analysis ( P {\textless} 0.05) provided further insights into the dysfunctional physiology, highlighting stress and inflammation pathways.

The searching algorithm is based on finding the argument of the minimum or maximum depending on the test, i.e., maximum for the Shapiro–Wilk and Shapiro–Francia, minimum for the rest. The artificial covariate method of Dag et al. (2014) is also included for comparison purposes. Simulation studies are implemented to compare the performances of the methods. Results show that Shapiro–Wilk and the artificial covariate method are more effective than the others and Pearson Chi-square is the worst performing method.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging threat to global public health. While our current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for SARS-CoV. Many infected individuals develop COVID-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia. Disease progression promotes the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can lead to multiple organ failure and death. ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. Importantly, targeting ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the following subtopics: 1) ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2; 2) clinical and pathological features of COVID-19; 3) role of ACE2 in the infection and pathogenesis of SARS; 4) potential pathogenic role of ACE2 in COVID-19; 5) animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics development for COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three strains of coronavirus: SARS-CoV, NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7. Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2→Angiotensin1-7→Mas receptor axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7. In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

	abstract = {Objectives
In searching for a noninvasive surrogate tissue having mimicry with the prooxidant/-proinflammatory hypertensive heart disease (HHD) phenotype, we turned to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We tested whether iterations in [Ca2+]i, [Zn2+]i and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes and PBMC would complement each other eliciting similar shifts in gene expression profiles in these tissues demonstrable during preclinical (wk 1) and pathologic (wk 4) stages of aldosterone/salt treatment (ALDOST).

Background
Inappropriate neurohormonal activation contributes to pathologic remodeling of myocardium in HHD associated with aldosteronism. In rats receiving chronic ALDOST, evidence of reparative fibrosis replacing necrotic cardiomyocytes and coronary vasculopathy appears at wk 4 associated with the induction of oxidative stress by mitochondria that overwhelms endogenous, largely Zn2+-based, antioxidant defenses. Biomarker-guided prediction of risk prior to the appearance of cardiac pathology would prove invaluable.

Methods
In PBMC and cardiomyocytes, quantitation of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ and Zn2+, H2O2 and 8-iosprostane levels, as well as isolation of RNA and gene expression, together with statistical and clustering analyses, and confirmation of genes by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR, were performed.

Results
Compared to controls, at wk 1 and 4 ALDOST, we found comparable: increments in [Ca2+]i, [Zn2+]i and 8-isoprotane coupled to increased H2O2 production in cardiac mitochondria and PBMC, together with the common networks of expression profiles dominated by genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation and repair. These included three central Ingenuity pathway-linked genes: p38MAPK, a stress-responsive protein; NFκB, a redox-sensitive transcription factor and a proinflammatory cascade it regulates; and TGF-β1, a fibrogenic cytokine involved in tissue repair.

Conclusions
Significant overlapping demonstrated in the molecular mimicry of PBMC and cardiomyocytes during preclinical and pathologic stages of ALDOST implicates that transcriptional signatures of PBMC may serve as early noninvasive and novel sentinels predictive of impending pathologic remodeling in HHD.},

The only gene set coordinately up-regulated by the existence of diabetes and down-regulated by glycemic control consisted of 48 genes involved in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. In contrast, the only gene set coordinately down-regulated by the existence of diabetes, but not altered by glycemic control consisted of 92 genes involved in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway.

In order to provide information on the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of T2DM, we analyzed the transcriptional expression patterns exhibited by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with T2DM compared to non-diabetic subjects, by investigating several biological processes: inflammatory and immune responses, responses to oxidative stress and hypoxia, fatty acid processing, and DNA repair. PBMCs were obtained from 20 T2DM patients and eight non-diabetic subjects. Total RNA was hybridized to Agilent whole human genome 4×44K one-color oligo-microarray. Microarray data were analyzed using the GeneSpring GX 11.0 software (Agilent). We used BRB-ArrayTools software (gene set analysis - GSA) to investigate significant gene sets and the Genomica tool to study a possible influence of clinical features on gene expression profiles. We showed that PBMCs from T2DM patients presented significant changes in gene expression, exhibiting 1320 differentially expressed genes compared to the control group. A great number of genes were involved in biological processes implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Among the genes with high fold-change values, the up-regulated ones were associated with fatty acid metabolism and protection against lipid-induced oxidative stress, while the down-regulated ones were implicated in the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines production and DNA repair. Moreover, we identified two significant signaling pathways: adipocytokine, related to insulin resistance; and ceramide, related to oxidative stress and induction of apoptosis. In addition, expression profiles were not influenced by patient features, such as age, gender, obesity, pre/post-menopause age, neuropathy, glycemia, and HbA(1c) percentage. Hence, by studying expression profiles of PBMCs, we provided quantitative and qualitative differences and similarities between T2DM patients and non-diabetic individuals, contributing with new perspectives for a better understanding of the disease.},

Monocytes and macrophages are the most enriched immune cell types in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and appear to have a central role in the pathogenicity of the disease. These cells adapt their metabolism upon infection and become highly glycolytic, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication. The infection triggers mitochondrial ROS production, which induces stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and consequently promotes glycolysis. HIF-1α-induced changes in monocyte metabolism by SARS-CoV-2 infection directly inhibit T cell response and reduce epithelial cell survival.

	abstract = {The spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can be proteolytically activated by cathepsins B and L upon viral uptake into target cell endosomes. In contrast, it is largely unknown whether host cell proteases located in the secretory pathway of infected cells and/or on the surface of target cells can cleave SARS S. We along with others could previously show that the type II transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 activates the influenza virus hemagglutinin and the human metapneumovirus F protein by cleavage. Here, we assessed whether SARS S is proteolytically processed by TMPRSS2. Western blot analysis revealed that SARS S was cleaved into several fragments upon coexpression of TMPRSS2 (cis-cleavage) and upon contact between SARS S-expressing cells and TMPRSS2-positive cells (trans-cleavage). cis-cleavage resulted in release of SARS S fragments into the cellular supernatant and in inhibition of antibody-mediated neutralization, most likely because SARS S fragments function as antibody decoys. trans-cleavage activated SARS S on effector cells for fusion with target cells and allowed efficient SARS S-driven viral entry into targets treated with a lysosomotropic agent or a cathepsin inhibitor. Finally, ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, and TMPRSS2 were found to be coexpressed by type II pneumocytes, which represent important viral target cells, suggesting that SARS S is cleaved by TMPRSS2 in the lung of SARS-CoV-infected individuals. In summary, we show that TMPRSS2 might promote viral spread and pathogenesis by diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and by activating SARS S for cell-cell and virus-cell fusion.},

	abstract = {The distribution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) receptor, an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), does not strictly correlate with SARS-CoV cell tropism in lungs; therefore, other cellular factors have been predicted to be required for activation of virus infection. In the present study, we identified transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), whose expression does correlate with SARS-CoV infection in the upper lobe of the lung. In Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2, large syncytia were induced by SARS-CoV infection. Further, the lysosome-tropic reagents failed to inhibit, whereas the heptad repeat peptide efficiently inhibited viral entry into cells, suggesting that TMPRSS2 affects the S protein at the cell surface and induces virus-plasma membrane fusion. On the other hand, production of virus in TMPRSS2-expressing cells did not result in S-protein cleavage or increased infectivity of the resulting virus. Thus, TMPRSS2 affects the entry of virus but not other phases of virus replication. We hypothesized that the spatial orientation of TMPRSS2 vis-a-vis S protein is a key mechanism underling this phenomenon. To test this, the TMPRSS2 and S proteins were expressed in cells labeled with fluorescent probes of different colors, and the cell-cell fusion between these cells was tested. Results indicate that TMPRSS2 needs to be expressed in the opposing (target) cell membrane to activate S protein rather than in the producer cell, as found for influenza A virus and metapneumoviruses. This is the first report of TMPRSS2 being required in the target cell for activation of a viral fusion protein but not for the S protein synthesized in and transported to the surface of cells. Our findings suggest that the TMPRSS2 expressed in lung tissues may be a determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity at the initial site of SARS-CoV infection.},

Among the 560 proteases encoded in the human genome, the metalloprotease A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) has gained much attention in recent years and has emerged as a central regulatory hub in inflammation, immunity and cancer development. In order to do so, ADAM17 cleaves a variety of substrates, among them the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and most ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This review article provides an overview of the functions of ADAM17 with a special focus on its cellular regulation. It highlights the importance of ADAM17 to understand the biology of IL-6 and TNFα and their role in inflammatory diseases. Finally, the role of ADAM17 in the formation and progression of different tumor entities is discussed.},

In addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral infectivity. However, no mechanistic insights into this process were obtained and the relevance of ACE2 cleavage for SARS-CoV S protein (SARS-S) activation has not been determined. Here, we show that arginine and lysine residues within ACE2 amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for cleavage by TMPRSS2 and HAT and that ACE2 processing is required for augmentation of SARS-S-driven entry by these proteases. In contrast, ACE2 cleavage was dispensable for activation of the viral S protein. Expression of TMPRSS2 increased cellular uptake of soluble SARS-S, suggesting that protease-dependent augmentation of viral entry might be due to increased uptake of virions into target cells. Finally, TMPRSS2 was found to compete with the metalloprotease ADAM17 for ACE2 processing, but only cleavage by TMPRSS2 resulted in augmented SARS-S-driven entry. Collectively, our results in conjunction with those of previous studies indicate that TMPRSS2 and potentially related proteases promote SARS-CoV entry by two separate mechanisms: ACE2 cleavage, which might promote viral uptake, and SARS-S cleavage, which activates the S protein for membrane fusion. These observations have interesting implications for the development of novel therapeutics. In addition, they should spur efforts to determine whether receptor cleavage promotes entry of other coronaviruses, which use peptidases as entry receptors.},

	abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012. Recently, the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) was identified and the specific interaction of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein and DPP4 was determined by crystallography. Animal studies identified rhesus macaques but not hamsters, ferrets, or mice to be susceptible for MERS-CoV. Here, we investigated the role of DPP4 in this observed species tropism. Cell lines of human and nonhuman primate origin were permissive of MERS-CoV, whereas hamster, ferret, or mouse cell lines were not, despite the presence of DPP4. Expression of human DPP4 in nonsusceptible BHK and ferret cells enabled MERS-CoV replication, whereas expression of hamster or ferret DPP4 did not. Modeling the binding energies of MERS-CoV spike protein RBD to DPP4 of human (susceptible) or hamster (nonsusceptible) identified five amino acid residues involved in the DPP4-RBD interaction. Expression of hamster DPP4 containing the five human DPP4 amino acids rendered BHK cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, whereas expression of human DPP4 containing the five hamster DPP4 amino acids did not. Using the same approach, the potential of MERS-CoV to utilize the DPP4s of common Middle Eastern livestock was investigated. Modeling of the DPP4 and MERS-CoV RBD interaction predicted the ability of MERS-CoV to bind the DPP4s of camel, goat, cow, and sheep. Expression of the DPP4s of these species on BHK cells supported MERS-CoV replication. This suggests, together with the abundant DPP4 presence in the respiratory tract, that these species might be able to function as a MERS-CoV intermediate reservoir.
IMPORTANCE: The ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 701 laboratory-confirmed cases to date, with 249 fatalities. Although bats and dromedary camels have been identified as potential MERS-CoV hosts, the virus has so far not been isolated from any species other than humans. The inability of MERS-CoV to infect commonly used animal models, such as hamster, mice, and ferrets, indicates the presence of a species barrier. We show that the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 plays a pivotal role in the observed species tropism of MERS-CoV and subsequently identified the amino acids in DPP4 responsible for this restriction. Using a combined modeling and experimental approach, we predict that, based on the ability of MERS-CoV to utilize the DPP4 of common Middle East livestock species, such as camels, goats, sheep, and cows, these form a potential MERS-CoV intermediate host reservoir species.},

	abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) uses the S1B domain of its spike protein to bind to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), its functional receptor, and its S1A domain to bind to sialic acids. The tissue localization of DPP4 in humans, bats, camelids, pigs, and rabbits generally correlates with MERS-CoV tropism, highlighting the role of DPP4 in virus pathogenesis and transmission. However, MERS-CoV S1A does not indiscriminately bind to all α2,3-sialic acids, and the species-specific binding and tissue distribution of these sialic acids in different MERS-CoV-susceptible species have not been investigated. We established a novel method to detect these sialic acids on tissue sections of various organs of different susceptible species by using nanoparticles displaying multivalent MERS-CoV S1A We found that the nanoparticles specifically bound to the nasal epithelial cells of dromedary camels, type II pneumocytes in human lungs, and the intestinal epithelial cells of common pipistrelle bats. Desialylation by neuraminidase abolished nanoparticle binding and significantly reduced MERS-CoV infection in primary susceptible cells. In contrast, S1A nanoparticles did not bind to the intestinal epithelium of serotine bats and frugivorous bat species, nor did they bind to the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits. Both pigs and rabbits have been shown to shed less infectious virus than dromedary camels and do not transmit the virus via either contact or airborne routes. Our results depict species-specific colocalization of MERS-CoV entry and attachment receptors, which may be relevant in the transmission and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV uses the S1B domain of its spike protein to attach to its host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The tissue localization of DPP4 has been mapped in different susceptible species. On the other hand, the S1A domain, the N-terminal domain of this spike protein, preferentially binds to several glycotopes of α2,3-sialic acids, the attachment factor of MERS-CoV. Here we show, using a novel method, that the S1A domain specifically binds to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels, alveolar epithelium of humans, and intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle bats. In contrast, it does not bind to the nasal epithelium of pigs or rabbits, nor does it bind to the intestinal epithelium of serotine bats and frugivorous bat species. This finding supports the importance of the S1A domain in MERS-CoV infection and tropism, suggests its role in transmission, and highlights its potential use as a component of novel vaccine candidates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade are reported to affect the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).
METHODS: As of May 2020, analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database in Korea. Using this dataset, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade. Additionally, we validated the results using the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea dataset.
RESULTS: Totally, data of 67,850 subjects were accessible in the HIRA dataset. Of these, 5,080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6\%) and 327 (39.3\%) were DPP4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09\%) received intensive care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.362 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.135 to 0.971), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.599 (95\% CI, 0.251 to 1.431). These findings were consistent with the analysis based on the NHIS data using 704 final subjects. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.303 (95\% CI, 0.135 to 0.682), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.811 (95\% CI, 0.391 to 1.682).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that DPP-4i is significantly associated with a better clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) have gained a key place in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) essentially because of their good safety profile even in the frail population. DPP-4, originally known as 'T-cell antigen CD26', is expressed in many immune cells and regulates their functions, so the initial concern over the use of DPP-4is was the possible increased susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, because of the high affinity between human DPP-4 and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it was suspected that this virus, responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), might be able to use the DPP-4 enzyme as a functional receptor to gain entry into the host. However, DPP-4is also exert anti-inflammatory effects, which could be beneficial in patients exposed to cytokine storms due to COVID-19. Yet, when observational (mostly retrospective) studies compared clinical outcomes in DPP-4i users vs non-users among diabetes patients with COVID-19, the overall results regarding the risk of progression towards more severe forms of the disease and mortality were heterogeneous, thereby precluding any definite conclusions. Nevertheless, new expectations have arisen following recent reports of significant reductions in admissions to intensive care units and mortality in DPP-4i users. However, given the limitations inherent in such observational studies, any available results should be considered, at best, as hypothetical and only suggestive of potentially substantial benefits with DPP-4is in diabetes patients with COVID-19. While the safe use of DPP-4is in COVID-19 patients appears to be an acceptable hypothesis, all such positive findings still need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials (a few of which are currently ongoing) before any recommendations can be made for clinical practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) studies from our laboratory and others described decreased natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and elevated proportion of lymphocytes expressing the activation marker, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) also known as CD26. However, neither these assays nor other laboratory tests are widely accepted for the diagnosis or prognosis of CFS. This study sought to determine if NKCC or DPPIV/CD26 have diagnostic accuracy for CFS.
METHODS/RESULTS: Subjects included female and male CFS cases and healthy controls. NK cell function was measured with a bioassay, using K562 cells and (51)Cr release. Lymphocyte associated DPPIV/CD26 was assayed by qualitative and quantitative flow cytometry. Serum DPPIV/CD26 was measured by ELISA. Analysis by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assessed biomarker potential. Cytotoxic function of NK cells for 176 CFS subjects was significantly lower than in the 230 controls. According to ROC analysis, NKCC was a good predictor of CFS status. There was no significant difference in NK cell counts between cases and controls. Percent CD2+ lymphocytes (T cells and NK cells) positive for DPPIV/C26 was elevated in CFS cases, but there was a decrease in the number of molecules (rMol) of DPPIV/C26 expressed on T cells and NK cells and a decrease in the soluble form of the enzyme in serum. Analyses by ROC curves indicated that all three measurements of DPPIV/CD26 demonstrated potential as biomarkers for CFS. None of the DPPIV/C26 assays were significantly correlated with NKCC.
CONCLUSIONS: By ROC analysis, NKCC and three methods of measuring DPPIV/C26 examined in this study had potential as biomarkers for CFS. Of these, NKCC, \%CD2+CD26+ lymphocytes and rMol CD26/CD2+ lymphocyte, required flow cytometry, fresh blood and access to a high complexity laboratory. Soluble DPPIV/C26 in serum is done with a standard ELISA assay, or with other soluble factors in a multiplex type of ELISA. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV on lymphocytes or in serum was not predictive of NKCC suggesting that these should be considered as non-redundant biomarkers. Abnormalities in DPPIV/CD26 and in NK cell function have particular relevance to the possible role of infection in the initiation and/or the persistence of CFS.},

	doi = {10.1093/glycob/cwab032},
	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that has higher contagious capacity than any other previous human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and causes the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Sialic acids are a group of nine-carbon acidic α-keto sugars, usually located at the end of glycans of cell surface glycoconjugates and serve as attachment sites for previous HCoVs. It is therefore speculated that sialic acids on the host cell surface could serve as co-receptors or attachment factors for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry as well. Recent in silico modeling, molecular modeling predictions and microscopy studies indicate potential sialic acid binding by SARS-CoV-2 upon cell entry. In particular, a flat sialic acid-binding domain was proposed at the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, which may lead to the initial contact and interaction of the virus on the epithelium followed by higher affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, likely a two-step attachment fashion. However, recent in vitro and ex vivo studies of sialic acids on ACE2 receptor confirmed an opposite role for SARS-CoV-2 binding. In particular, neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells and ACE2-expressing 293T cells increased SARS-CoV-2 binding. Furthermore, the ACE2 glycosylation inhibition studies indicate that sialic acids on ACE2 receptor prevent ACE2-spike protein interaction. On the other hand, a most recent study indicates that gangliosides could serve as ligands for receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This mini-review discusses what has been predicted and known so far about the role of sialic acid for SARS-CoV-2 infection and future research perspective.},

Adaptive and innate immune defense mechanisms are established there to inactivate or eliminate pathogenic microbes that traverse the oral environment on the way to their target organs and tissues.

It has long been acknowledged that glycobiological and glycoimmunological aspects play a pivotal role in oral host-microbe, microbe-host, and microbe-microbe interactions in the mouth. In this review, we aim to delineate how glycan-mediated host defense mechanisms in the oral cavity support human health. We will describe the role of glycans attached to large molecular size salivary glycoproteins which act as a first line of primordial host defense in the human mouth. We will further discuss how glycan recognition contributes to both colonization and clearance of oral microbes.},

The lack of effective treatment strategy and vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 poses a threat to human health. An extremely high infection rate and multi-organ secondary infection within a short period of time makes this virus more deadly and challenging for therapeutic interventions. Despite high sequence similarity and utilization of common host-cell receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for virus entry, SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. Structure-based sequence comparison of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 illustrate three divergent loop regions in SARS-CoV-2, which is reminiscent of MERS-CoV sialoside binding pockets. Comparative binding analysis with host sialosides revealed conformational flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 divergent loop regions to accommodate diverse glycan-rich sialosides. These key differences with SARS-CoV and similarity with MERS-CoV suggest an evolutionary adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein reciprocal interaction with host surface sialosides to infect host cells with wide tissue tropism.},

The impact of this post-translational modification on viral entry is yet unestablished. We expressed different glycoforms of the Spike-protein and ACE2 in CRISPR-Cas9 glycoengineered cells, and developed corresponding SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding. However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spike-protein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2 and decreasing viral entry. Overall, chemical inhibitors of glycosylation may be evaluated for COVID-19.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disabling condition with unknown disease mechanisms and few treatment options.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the pathophysiology of CFS and assess clonidine hydrochloride pharmacotherapy in adolescents with CFS by using a hypothesis that patients with CFS have enhanced sympathetic activity and that sympatho-inhibition by clonidine would improve symptoms and function.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were enrolled from a single referral center recruiting nationwide in Norway. A referred sample of 176 adolescents with CFS was assessed for eligibility; 120 were included (34 males and 86 females; mean age, 15.4 years). A volunteer sample of 68 healthy adolescents serving as controls was included (22 males and 46 females; mean age, 15.1 years). The CSF patients and healthy controls were assessed cross-sectionally at baseline. Thereafter, patients with CFS were randomized 1:1 to treatment with low-dose clonidine or placebo for 9 weeks and monitored for 30 weeks; double-blinding was provided. Data were collected from March 2010 until October 2012 as part of the Norwegian Study of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in Adolescents: Pathophysiology and Intervention Trial.
INTERVENTIONS: Clonidine hydrochloride capsules (25 µg or 50 µg twice daily for body weight {\textless}35 kg or {\textgreater}35 kg, respectively) vs placebo capsules for 9 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of steps per day.
RESULTS: At baseline, patients with CFS had a lower number of steps per day (P {\textless} .001), digit span backward score (P = .002), and urinary cortisol to creatinine ratio (P = .001), and a higher fatigue score (P {\textless} .001), heart rate responsiveness (P = .02), plasma norepinephrine level (P {\textless} .001), and serum C-reactive protein concentration (P = .04) compared with healthy controls. There were no significant differences regarding blood microbiology evaluation. During intervention, the clonidine group had a lower number of steps per day (mean difference, -637 steps; P = .07), lower plasma norepinephrine level (mean difference, -42 pg/mL; P = .01), and lower serum C-reactive protein concentration (mean ratio, 0.69; P = .02) compared with the CFS placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adolescent CFS is associated with enhanced sympathetic nervous activity, low-grade systemic inflammation, attenuated hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis function, cognitive impairment, and large activity reduction, but not with common microorganisms. Low-dose clonidine attenuates sympathetic outflow and systemic inflammation in CFS but has a concomitant negative effect on physical activity; thus, sympathetic and inflammatory enhancement may be compensatory mechanisms. Low-dose clonidine is not clinically useful in CFS.

We suggest that sustained arousal can originate from different precipitating factors (infections, psychosocial challenges) interacting with predisposing factors (genetic traits, personality) and learned expectancies (classical and operant conditioning). Furthermore, sustained arousal may explain documented alterations by establishing vicious circles within immunology (Th2 (humoral) vs Th1 (cellular) predominance), endocrinology (attenuated HPA axis), skeletal muscle function (attenuated cortical activation, increased oxidative stress) and cognition (impaired memory and information processing). Finally, we propose a causal link between sustained arousal and the experience of fatigue.

While the elderly are most severely affected, implicating an age bias, a striking factor in the demographics of this deadly disease is the gender bias, with higher numbers of cases, greater disease severity, and higher death rates among men than women across the lifespan. While pre-existing comorbidities and social, behavioral, and lifestyle factors contribute to this bias, biological factors underlying the host immune response may be crucial contributors. Women mount stronger immune responses to infections and vaccinations and outlive men. Sex-based biological factors underlying the immune response are therefore important determinants of susceptibility to infections, disease outcomes, and mortality. Despite this, gender is a profoundly understudied and often overlooked variable in research related to the immune response and infectious diseases, and it is largely ignored in drug and vaccine clinical trials. Understanding these factors will not only help better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but it will also guide the design of effective therapies and vaccine strategies for gender-based personalized medicine. This review focuses on sex-based differences in genes, sex hormones, and the microbiome underlying the host immune response and their relevance to infections with a focus on coronaviruses.},

Evidence has emerged very slowly due to the multiplicity, lack of specificity, delayed onset, and frequent medical underestimation of ME/CFS symptoms. It was supported by an epidemiological study comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated militaries that remained undeployed during Gulf War II. Affected patients suffer from cognitive dysfunction affecting attention, memory and inter-hemispheric connexions, well correlated to brain perfusion defects and associated with a stereotyped and distinctive pattern of cerebral glucose hypometabolism. Deltoid muscle biopsy performed to investigate myalgia typically yields macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF), a histological biomarker assessing longstanding persistency of aluminum agglomerates within innate immune cells at site of previous immunization. MMF is seemingly linked to altered mineral particle detoxification by the xeno/autophagy machinery. Comparing toxicology of different forms of aluminum and different types of exposure is misleading and inadequate and small animal experiments have turned old dogma upside down. Instead of being rapidly solubilized in the extracellular space, injected aluminum particles are quickly captured by immune cells and transported to distant organs and the brain where they elicit an inflammatory response and exert selective low dose long-term neurotoxicity. Clinical observations and experiments in sheep, a large animal like humans, confirmed both systemic diffusion and neurotoxic effects of aluminum adjuvants. Post-immunization ME/CFS represents the core manifestation of "autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants" (ASIA).},

At present, Omicron variants have become mainstream. In this work, we carried out a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the reported spike protein antibodies, counting the epitopes and genotypes of these antibodies. We further comprehensively analyzed the impact of Omicron mutations on antibody epitopes and classified these antibodies according to their binding patterns. We found that the epitopes of the H-RBD class antibodies were significantly less affected by Omicron mutations than other classes. Binding and virus neutralization experiments showed that such antibodies could effectively inhibit the immune escape of Omicron. Cryo-EM results showed that this class of antibodies utilized a conserved mechanism to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Our results greatly help us deeply understand the impact of Omicron mutations. Meanwhile, it also provides guidance and insights for developing Omicron antibodies and vaccines.},

Here, we track SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody responses up to six months following Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection in six mRNA-vaccinated individuals. Cross-reactive serum neutralizing antibody and memory B cell (MBC) responses decline by two- to four-fold through the study period. Breakthrough infection elicits minimal de novo Omicron BA.1-specific B cell responses but drives affinity maturation of pre-existing cross-reactive MBCs toward BA.1, which translates into enhanced breadth of activity across other variants. Public clones dominate the neutralizing antibody response at both early and late time points following breakthough infection, and their escape mutation profiles predict newly emergent Omicron sublineages, suggesting that convergent antibody responses continue to shape SARS-CoV-2 evolution. While the study is limited by our relatively small cohort size, these results suggest that heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variant exposure drives the evolution of B cell memory, supporting the continued development of next-generation variant-based vaccines.},

This raised great concern about the presumably-rapid but unreported spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in a very large population of very low pre-existing immunity. By modeling a combination of case count and survey data, we show that Omicron spread extremely rapidly, at a rate of 0.42/day (95\% credibility interval: [0.35, 0.51]/day), translating to an epidemic doubling time of 1.6 days ([1.6, 2.0] days) after the full exit from zero-COVID on Dec. 7, 2022. Consequently, we estimate that the vast majority of the population (97\% [95\%, 99\%], sensitivity analysis lower limit of 90\%) was infected during December, with the nation-wide epidemic peaking on Dec. 23. Overall, our results highlight the extremely high transmissibility of the variant and the importance of proper design of intervention exit strategies to avoid large infection waves.},

Concerns have been raised that omicron breakthrough infections in triple-vaccinated individuals result in poor induction of omicron-specific immunity, and that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with immune dampening. Taking a broad and comprehensive approach, we characterize mucosal and blood immunity to spike and non-spike antigens following BA.1/BA.2 infections in triple mRNA-vaccinated individuals, with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that most individuals increase BA.1/BA.2/BA.5-specific neutralizing antibodies following infection, but confirm that the magnitude of increase and post-omicron titres are higher in the infection-naive. In contrast, significant increases in nasal responses, including neutralizing activity against BA.5 spike, are seen regardless of infection history. Spike-specific T cells increase only in infection-naive vaccinees; however, post-omicron T cell responses are significantly higher in the previously-infected, who display a maximally induced response with a highly cytotoxic CD8+ phenotype following their 3rd mRNA vaccine dose. Responses to non-spike antigens increase significantly regardless of prior infection status. These findings suggest that hybrid immunity induced by omicron breakthrough infections is characterized by significant immune enhancement that can help protect against future omicron variants.},

By December 2021, omicron had caused over a million global daily cases to grow massively, and it had begun to replicate subvariants. Several new subvariants emerged at the end of November 2022, including BF.5, BF.7, BQ.1 and BQ.1.1. This study conducted an exploratory investigation into the propagation rate of 33 SARS-CoV-2 omicron subvariants along with their ancestor that were prevalent in the United States and around the world in mid-December 2022. As a result, among omicron variant and 33 subvariants, out of 3,306,275 sequences in the United States as of mid-December 2022, the propagation rate of omicron variant and its subvariants, such as B.1.1.529, BA.2, BA.1, BA.1.10, BA.1.1, BA.5, BA.5.2, BA.5.2.1, BA.4, BA.5.1, BA.5.3, BA.5.3.1, BA.5.5, BE.1, BE.1.1, BE.1.1.1 and BQ.1 were found to be 29\%, 17\%, 13\%, 11\%, 7\%, 7\%, 4\%, 2\%, 1\%, 1\%, 1\%, 1\%, 1\%, 1\%, 1\%, 1\% and 1\%.

To date, there are no clinical validated assays for pan-SARS-coronavirus (pan-SARS-CoV) detection. Here, we suggest an innovative primer design strategy for the diagnosis of pan-SARS-CoVs targeting the envelope (E) gene using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, we developed a new primer–probe set targeting human β2-microglobulin (B2M) as an RNA-based internal control for process efficacy. The universal RT-qPCR assay demonstrated no false-positive amplifications with other human coronaviruses or 20 common respiratory viruses, and its limit of detection (LOD) was 159.16 copies/ml at 95\% detection probability. In clinical validation, the assay delivered 100\% sensitive results in the detection of SARS-CoV-2-positive oropharyngeal samples (n = 120), including three variants of concern (Wuhan, Delta, and Omicron). Taken together, this universal RT-qPCR assay provides a highly sensitive, robust, and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and animal-derived SARS-related CoVs.},

Nine months after primary vaccination, previously infected subjects exhibited higher residual antibody levels, with significant neutralizing activity against distinct variants compared to infection-naïve subjects. The higher humoral response was associated with higher levels of receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG+ and IgA+ memory B cells. The booster dose increased neither neutralizing activity, nor the B and T cell frequencies. Conversely, infection-naïve subjects needed the booster to achieve comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies as those found in previously infected subjects after primary vaccination. The neutralizing titer correlated with anti-RBD IFNγ producing T cells, in the face of sustained B cell response. Notably, pre-pandemic samples showed high Omicron cross-reactivity. These data show the importance of the booster dose in reinforcing immunological memory and increasing circulating antibodies in infection-naïve subjects.},

	abstract = {Background In summer 2022, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 became dominant in Europe. In vitro studies have shown a large reduction of antibody neutralisation for this variant. Aim We aimed to investigate differences in protection from previous infection and/or vaccination against infection with Omicron BA.4/5 vs BA.2. Methods We employed a case-only approach including positive PCR tests from community testing between 2 May and 24 July 2022 that were tested for S gene target failure (SGTF), which distinguishes BA.4/5 from BA.2 infection. Previous infections were categorised by variant using whole genome sequencing or SGTF. We estimated by logistic regression the association of SGTF with vaccination and/or previous infection, and of SGTF of the current infection with the variant of the previous infection, adjusting for testing week, age group and sex. Results The percentage of registered previous SARS-CoV-2 infections was higher among 19,836 persons infected with Omicron BA.4/5 than among 7,052 persons infected with BA.2 (31.3\% vs 20.0\%). Adjusting for testing week, age group and sex, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 1.4 (95\% CI: 1.3–1.5). The distribution of vaccination status did not differ for BA.4/5 vs BA.2 infections (aOR = 1.1 for primary and booster vaccination). Among persons with a previous infection, those currently infected with BA4/5 had a shorter interval between infections, and the previous infection was more often caused by BA.1, compared with those currently infected with BA.2 (aOR = 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.5–2.6). Conclusion Our results suggest immunity induced by BA.1 is less effective against BA.4/5 infection than against BA.2 infection.},

We analyzed immune responses in whom had been boosted once and did not have COVID-19 (n = 16), boosted once and had COVID-19 when BA.1/2 was dominant in Korea (Hybrid-6M group, n = 27), and boosted twice and did not have COVID-19 (Vx4 group, n = 15). Antibody binding activities against RBDo BA.1 and RBDo BA.4/5, antigen-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against BA.4/5, and B-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type did not differ statistically between the Hybrid-6M and Vx4 groups. The humoral and cellular immune responses of the Hybrid-6M group against BA.4/5 were comparable to those of the Vx4 group.

Although first-generation vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death, robust evidence on vaccine effectiveness (VE) against all Omicron infections, irrespective of symptoms, remains sparse. We used a community-wide serosurvey with 5,310 subjects to estimate how vaccination histories modulated risk of infection in infection-naive Hong Kong during a large wave of Omicron BA.2 epidemic in January–July 2022. We estimated that Omicron infected 45\% (41–48\%) of the local population. Three and four doses of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac were effective against Omicron infection 7 days after vaccination (VE of 48\% (95\% credible interval 34–64\%) and 69\% (46–98\%) for three and four doses of BNT162b2, respectively; VE of 30\% (1–66\%) and 56\% (6–97\%) for three and four doses of CoronaVac, respectively). At 100 days after immunization, VE waned to 26\% (7–41\%) and 35\% (10–71\%) for three and four doses of BNT162b2, and to 6\% (0–29\%) and 11\% (0–54\%) for three and four doses of CoronaVac. The rapid waning of VE against infection conferred by first-generation vaccines and an increasingly complex viral evolutionary landscape highlight the necessity for rapidly deploying updated vaccines followed by vigilant monitoring of VE.},

	abstract = {New Zealand experienced a wave of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2022, which occurred against a backdrop of high two-dose vaccination rates, ongoing roll-out of boosters and paediatric doses, and negligible levels of prior infection. New Omicron subvariants have subsequently emerged with a significant growth advantage over the previously dominant BA.2. We investigated a mathematical model that included waning of vaccine-derived and infection-derived immunity, as well as the impact of the BA.5 subvariant which began spreading in New Zealand in May 2022. The model was used to provide scenarios to the New Zealand Government with differing levels of BA.5 growth advantage, helping to inform policy response and healthcare system preparedness during the winter period. In all scenarios investigated, the projected peak in new infections during the BA.5 wave was smaller than in the first Omicron wave in March 2022. However, results indicated that the peak hospital occupancy was likely to be higher than in March 2022, primarily due to a shift in the age distribution of infections to older groups. We compare model results with subsequent epidemiological data and show that the model provided a good projection of cases, hospitalizations and deaths during the BA.5 wave.},

On this background, it is crucial but challenging to define current and future vaccine policy in a population with a high immunity against SARS-CoV-2 conferred by previous infections and/or vaccinations. Vaccine policy must consider the magnitude of the risks conferred by new infection(s) with current and evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants, how these risks vary in different groups of individuals, how to balance these risks against the apparently small, but existent, risks of harms of vaccination, and the cost–benefit of different options. More evidence from randomized controlled trials and continuously accumulating national health data is required to inform shared decision-making with people who consider vaccination options. Vaccine policy makers should cautiously weight what vaccination schedules are needed, and refrain from urging frequent vaccine boosters unless supported by sufficient evidence.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 has emerged as a pandemic leading to a global public health crisis of unprecedented morbidity. A comprehensive insight into the imaging of COVID-19 has enabled early diagnosis, stratification of disease severity, and identification of potential sequelae. The evolution of COVID-19 can be divided into early infectious, pulmonary, and hyperinflammatory phases. Clinical features, imaging features, and management are different among the three phases. In the early stage, peripheral ground-glass opacities are predominant CT findings, and therapy directly targeting SARS-CoV-2 is effective. In the later stage, organizing pneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage pattern are predominant CT findings and anti-inflammatory therapies are more beneficial. The risk of severe disease or hospitalization is lower in breakthrough or Omicron variant infection compared with nonimmunized or Delta variant infections. The protection rates of the fourth dose of mRNA vaccination were 34\% and 67\% against overall infection and hospitalizations for severe illness, respectively. After acute COVID-19 pneumonia, most residual CT abnormalities gradually decreased in extent, but they may remain as linear or multifocal reticular or cystic lesions. Advanced insights into the pathophysiologic and imaging features of COVID-19 along with vaccine benefits have improved patient care, but emerging knowledge of post–COVID-19 condition, or long COVID, also presents radiology with new challenges.

	abstract = {Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, several Omicron sublineages have emerged, supplanting their predecessors. Here we compared the neutralization of Omicron sublineages BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 by human sera collected from individuals who were infected with the ancestral B.1 (D614G) strain, who were vaccinated (3 doses) or with breakthrough infection with pre-Omicron strains (Gamma or Delta). All Omicron sublineages exhibited extensive escape from all sera when compared to the ancestral B.1 strain and to Delta, albeit to different levels depending on the origin of the sera. Convalescent sera were unable to neutralize BA.1, and partly neutralized BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5. Vaccinee sera partly neutralized BA.2, but BA.1, BA.4 and BA.5 evaded neutralizing antibodies (NAb). Some breakthrough infections (BTI) sera were non-neutralizing. Neutralizing BTI sera had similar neutralizing ability against all Omicron sublineages. Despite similar levels of anti-Spike and anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) antibodies in all groups, BTI sera had the highest cross-neutralizing ability against all Omicron sublineages and convalescent sera were the least neutralizing. Antibody avidity inferred from the NT50:antibody titer ratio was highest in sera from BTI patients, underscoring qualitative differences in antibodies elicited by infection or vaccination. Together, these findings highlight the importance of vaccination to trigger highly cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize phylogenetically and antigenically distant strains, and suggest that immune imprinting by first generation vaccines may restrict, but not abolish, cross-neutralization.},

	abstract = {The aim of this ecological study is to evaluate correlations between the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in three Italian provinces—one in the south, one in the center and one in the north of the country—and the registered numbers of COVID-19 cases in the same areas. The period of January 2021–September 2022 was considered, with specific analysis for fractions of times corresponding to the spread in Italy of the different SARS-CoV-2 variants. The results confirm the reduction of the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing new COVID-19 cases in Italy, regardless of latitude, after the appearance of the first omicron variants. The new variants omicron 4 and 5 showed an extremely high spread during the Italian summer months; fortunately, the effects of the vaccinations in preventing new cases was improved compared to the previous omicron variants, showing a negative correlation between the new COVID-19 cases and the number of vaccine doses administered.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, nearly 12.2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered worldwide; however, the humoral immune responses induced by different types of vaccines are yet to be fully validated. Methods. We analyzed antibody levels in 100 serum samples after vaccination with different types of COVID-19 vaccines and their reactivity against the RBD antigen of Delta and Omicron variants using a bead-based microarray. Results. Elevated levels of anti-wild-type (WT)-RBD IgG and anti-WT-NP IgG were detected in participants who received two doses of the inactivated vaccines (CoronaVac or BBIBP-CorV) and three doses of the recombinant spike protein vaccine (ZF2001), indicating that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 were generated regardless of the vaccine administered. We found highly correlated levels of serum anti-RBD IgG and anti-NP IgG (r = 0.432, p {\textless} 0.001). We observed that the antibodies produced in vivo after COVID-19 vaccination still reacted with variants of SARS-CoV-2 (p {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions. Our results show that high levels of specific antibodies can be produced after completion of COVID-19 vaccination (two doses of the inactivated vaccines or three doses of ZF2001), with some degree of cross-reactivity to the RBD antigen of Delta and Omicron variants, and provide an accessible and practical experimental method for post-vaccination antibody detection.},

Children infected during the pre-omicron era developed long lasting (at least 10-12 months) humoral and cellular immunity against pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants, but have reduced in vitro cross-reactivity against Omicron. Conversely, although vaccination has a limited efficacy in preventing new infection with pre-Omicron and Omicron variants, in vitro studies suggested that vaccine-induced immunity provides better in vitro cross-neutralization against pre-Omicron and Omicron variants. Preprints published after the period of inclusion of our review suggested that overall risk of infection after Omicron infection is reduced, but children developed weak neutralizing responses in about half cases.ConclusionsAvailable evidence, although limited, suggested a long-lasting but unperfect protection of previous infections or vaccination against pre-Omicron and Omicron variants. Based on our findings, it might be reasonable to offer families of children infected before Omicron a booster vaccination. A similar indication should be proposed also for those infected with Omicron, specifically for more fragile children at higher risk of COVID-19-related complications, based on better cross-variant neutralisation induced by vaccination.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO, identifier ID 353189.},

	abstract = {IntroductionA key feature of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with different transmission characteristics. However, when a novel variant arrives in a host population, it will not necessarily lead to many cases. Instead, it may fade out, due to stochastic effects and the level of immunity in the population. Immunity against novel SARS-CoV-2 variants may be influenced by prior exposures to related viruses, such as other SARS-CoV-2 variants and seasonal coronaviruses, and the level of cross-reactive immunity conferred by those exposures.MethodsHere, we investigate the impact of cross-reactive immunity on the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a simplified scenario in which a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant is introduced after an antigenically related virus has spread in the population. We use mathematical modelling to explore the risk that the novel variant invades the population and causes a large number of cases, as opposed to fading out with few cases.ResultsWe find that, if cross-reactive immunity is complete (i.e. someone infected by the previously circulating virus is not susceptible to the novel variant), the novel variant must be more transmissible than the previous virus to invade the population. However, in a more realistic scenario in which cross-reactive immunity is partial, we show that it is possible for novel variants to invade, even if they are less transmissible than previously circulating viruses. This is because partial cross-reactive immunity effectively increases the pool of susceptible hosts that are available to the novel variant compared to complete cross-reactive immunity. Furthermore, if previous infection with the antigenically related virus assists the establishment of infection with the novel variant, as has been proposed following some experimental studies, then even variants with very limited transmissibility are able to invade the host population.DiscussionOur results highlight that fast assessment of the level of cross-reactive immunity conferred by related viruses against novel SARS-CoV-2 variants is an essential component of novel variant risk assessments.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) have prolonged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by escaping pre-existing immunity acquired by natural infection or vaccination. Elucidation of VOCs' mutation trends and evasion of neutralization is required to update current control measures. Mutations and the prevalence of VOCs were analyzed in the global immunization coverage rate context. Lentivirus-based pseudovirus neutralization analysis platforms for SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain (PS) and VOCs, containing Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, were constructed based on the spike protein of each variant and HEK 293T cell line expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor on the surface, and an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter. Serum samples from 65 convalescent individuals and 20 WIBP-CorV vaccine recipients and four therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) namely imdevimab, casirivimab, bamlanivimab, and etesevimab were used to evaluate the neutralization potency against the variants. Pseudovirus-based neutralization assay platforms for PS and VOCs were established, and multiplicity of infection (MOI) was the key factor influencing the assay result. Compared to PS, VOCs may enhance the infectivity of hACE2-293T cells. Except for Alpha, other VOCs escaped neutralization to varying degrees. Attributed to favorable and emerging mutations, the current pandemic Omicron variant of all VOCs demonstrated the most significant neutralization-escaping ability to the sera and mAbs. Compared with the PS pseudovirus, Omicron had 15.7- and 3.71-fold decreases in the NT50 value (the highest serum dilution corresponding to a neutralization rate of 50\%); and correspondingly, 90\% and 43\% of immunization or convalescent serum samples lost their neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant, respectively. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved persistently with a strong ability to escape neutralization and prevailing against the established immune barrier. Our findings provide important clues to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic caused by new variants.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 viral load and detection of infectious virus in the respiratory tract are the two key parameters for estimating infectiousness. As shedding of infectious virus is required for onward transmission, understanding shedding characteristics is relevant for public health interventions. Viral shedding is influenced by biological characteristics of the virus, host factors and pre-existing immunity (previous infection or vaccination) of the infected individual. Although the process of human-to-human transmission is multifactorial, viral load substantially contributed to human-to-human transmission, with higher viral load posing a greater risk for onward transmission. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have further complicated the picture of virus shedding. As underlying immunity in the population through previous infection, vaccination or a combination of both has rapidly increased on a global scale after almost 3 years of the pandemic, viral shedding patterns have become more distinct from those of ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that influence infectious virus shedding and the period during which individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are contagious is crucial to guide public health measures and limit transmission. Furthermore, diagnostic tools to demonstrate the presence of infectious virus from routine diagnostic specimens are needed.},

Despite the low hospitalizations and lower death rate, the surges by these variants may offset public health measures and disrupt health care facilities as seen recently in Portugal and the USA. Interestingly these BA.4/BA.5 variants have been found to be more severe than the earlier-emerged Omicron variants. We believe that aggressive COVID-19 surveillance using affordable testing strategies might actually help understand the evolution and transmission pattern of new variants. The sudden dip in reporting of new cases in some of the low- and middle-income countries is an alarming situation and needs to be addressed as this could lead to undetected transmission of future variants of interest/concern of SARS-CoV-2 in large population settings, including advent of a ‘super’ virus. It would be interesting to examine the possible role/influence, if any, of the two different kinds of vaccines, the spike protein-based versus the inactivated whole virus, in the evolution of BA.4/BA.5.},

Mucosal immunity developing after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination in this part of the body represents one of the most efficient deterrents for preventing viral infection. Nonetheless, the complete lack of such protection in SARS-CoV-2 naïve or seronegative subjects, the limited capacity of neutralizing new and highly mutated lineages, along with the progressive waning of mucosal immunity over time, lead the way to considering alternative strategies for constructing new walls that could stop or entrap the virus at the nasal mucosa surface, which is the area primarily colonized by the new SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages. Among various infection preventive strategies, those based on generating physical barriers within the nose, aimed at impeding host cell penetration (i.e., using compounds with mucoadhesive properties, which act by hindering, entrapping or adsorbing the virus), or those preventing the association of SARS-CoV-2 with its cellular receptors (i.e., administering anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies or agents that inhibit priming or binding of the spike protein) could be considered appealing perspectives. Provided that these agents are proven safe, comfortable, and compatible with daily life, we suggest prioritizing their usage in subjects at enhanced risk of contagion, during high-risk activities, as well as in patients more likely to develop severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 omicron subvariants BA.1 and BA.2 became dominant in many countries in early 2022. These subvariants are now being displaced by BA.4 and BA.5. While natural infection with BA.1/BA.2 provides some protection against BA.4/BA.5 infection, the duration of this protection remains unknown.
We used the national Portuguese COVID-19 registry to investigate the waning of protective immunity conferred by prior BA.1/BA.2 infection towards BA.5. We divided the individuals infected during the period of BA.1/BA.2 dominance ({\textgreater}90\% of sample isolates) in successive 15-day intervals and determined the risk of subsequent infection with BA.5 over a fixed period.
Compared with uninfected people, one previous infection conferred substantial protection against BA.5 re-infection at 3 months (RR=0.12; 95\% CI: 0.11-0.12). However, although still significant, the protection was reduced by two-fold at 5 months post-infection (RR=0.24; 0.23-0.24).
These results should be interpreted in the context of vaccine breakthrough infections, as the vaccination coverage in the individuals included in the analyses is {\textgreater}98\% since the end of 2021.
This waning of protection following BA.1/BA.2 infection highlights the need to assess the stability and durability of immune protection induced with the adapted vaccines (based on BA.1) over time.},

	abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.5 subvariant is progressively displacing earlier subvariants, BA.1 and BA.2, in many countries. One possible explanation is the ability of BA.5 to evade immune responses elicited by prior BA.1 and BA.2 infections. The impact of BA.1 infection on the risk of reinfection with BA.5 is a critical issue because adapted vaccines under current clinical development are based on BA.1.
We used the national Portuguese COVID-19 registry to analyze the risk of BA.5 infection in individuals without a documented infection or previously infected during periods of distinct variants’ predominance (Wuhan-Hu-1, alpha, delta, BA.1/BA.2). National predominance periods were established according to the national SARS-CoV-2 genetic surveillance data (when one variant represented {\textgreater}90\% of the sample isolates).
We found that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced the risk for BA.5 infection. The protection effectiveness, related to the uninfected group, for a first infection with Wuhan-Hu-1 was 52.9\% (95\% CI, 51.9 – 53.9\%), for Alpha 54.9\% (51.2 – 58.3\%), for Delta 62.3\% (61.4 – 63.3\%), and for BA.1/BA.2 80.0\% (79.7 – 80.2\%).
The results ought to be interpreted in the context of breakthrough infections within a population with a very high vaccine coverage ({\textgreater}98\% of the study population completed the primary vaccination series).
In conclusion, infection with BA.1/BA.2 reduces the risk for breakthrough infections with BA.5 in a highly vaccinated population. This finding is critical to appraise the current epidemiological situation and the development of adapted vaccines.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron sublineages BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 exhibit higher transmissibility than the BA.2 lineage1. The receptor binding and immune-evasion capability of these recently emerged variants require immediate investigation. Here, coupled with structural comparisons of the spike proteins, we show that BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 (BA.4 and BA.5 are hereafter referred collectively to as BA.4/BA.5) exhibit similar binding affinities to BA.2 for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Of note, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 display increased evasion of neutralizing antibodies compared with BA.2 against plasma from triple-vaccinated individuals or from individuals who developed a BA.1 infection after vaccination. To delineate the underlying antibody-evasion mechanism, we determined the escape mutation profiles2, epitope distribution3 and Omicron-neutralization efficiency of 1,640 neutralizing antibodies directed against the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein, including 614 antibodies isolated from people who had recovered from BA.1 infection. BA.1 infection after vaccination predominantly recalls humoral immune memory directed against ancestral (hereafter referred to as wild-type (WT)) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The resulting elicited antibodies could neutralize both WT SARS-CoV-2 and BA.1 and are enriched on epitopes on spike that do not bind ACE2. However, most of these cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies are evaded by spike mutants L452Q, L452R and F486V. BA.1 infection can also induce new clones of BA.1-specific antibodies that potently neutralize BA.1. Nevertheless, these neutralizing antibodies are largely evaded by BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 owing to D405N and F486V mutations, and react weakly to pre-Omicron variants, exhibiting narrow neutralization breadths. The therapeutic neutralizing antibodies bebtelovimab4 and cilgavimab5 can effectively neutralize BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5, whereas the S371F, D405N and R408S mutations undermine most broadly sarbecovirus-neutralizing antibodies. Together, our results indicate that Omicron may evolve mutations to evade the humoral immunity elicited by BA.1 infection, suggesting that BA.1-derived vaccine boosters may not achieve broad-spectrum protection against new Omicron variants.},

Cases (SARS-CoV-2-positive test results) and controls (SARS-CoV-2-negative test results) were matched according to sex, 10-year age group, nationality, comorbid condition count, calendar week of testing, method of testing, and reason for testing. Effectiveness was estimated using the S-gene “target failure” (SGTF) infections between May 7, 2022-July 4, 2022. SGTF status provides a proxy for BA.4/BA.5 infections, considering the negligible incidence of other SGTF variants during the study. Effectiveness was also estimated using all diagnosed infections between June 8, 2022-July 4, 2022, when BA.4/BA.5 dominated incidence. Effectiveness of a previous pre-Omicron infection against symptomatic BA.4/BA.5 reinfection was 15.1\% (95\% CI: -47.1-50.9\%), and against any BA.4/BA.5 reinfection irrespective of symptoms was 28.3\% (95\% CI: 11.4-41.9\%). Effectiveness of a previous Omicron infection against symptomatic BA.4/BA.5 reinfection was 76.1\% (95\% CI: 54.9-87.3\%), and against any BA.4/BA.5 reinfection was 79.7\% (95\% CI: 74.3-83.9\%). Results using all diagnosed infections when BA.4/BA.5 dominated incidence confirmed the same findings. Sensitivity analyses adjusting for vaccination status confirmed study results. Protection of a previous infection against BA.4/BA.5 reinfection was modest when the previous infection involved a pre-Omicron variant, but strong when the previous infection involved the Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 subvariants. Protection of a previous infection against BA.4/BA.5 was lower than that against BA.1/BA.2, consistent with BA.4/BA.5’s greater capacity for immune-system evasion than that of BA.1/BA.2.},

	abstract = {Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted an urgent need to use infection testing databases to rapidly estimate effectiveness of prior infection in preventing reinfection (PES) by novel variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Methods Mathematical modeling was used to demonstrate the applicability of the test-negative, case-control study design to derive PES. Modeling was also used to investigate effects of bias in PES estimation. The test-negative design was applied to national-level testing data in Qatar to estimate PES for SARS-CoV-2 infection and to validate this design.
Results Apart from the very early phase of an epidemic, the difference between the test-negative estimate for PES and the true value of PES was minimal and became negligible as the epidemic progressed. The test-negative design provided robust estimation of PES even when PES began to wane after prior infection. Assuming that only 25\% of prior infections are documented, misclassification of prior infection status underestimated PES, but the underestimate was considerable only when {\textgreater}50\% of the population was ever infected. Misclassification of latent infection, misclassification of current active infection, and scale-up of vaccination all resulted in negligible bias in estimated PES. PES against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Beta variants was estimated at 97.0\% (95\% CI: 93.6-98.6) and 85.5\% (95\% CI: 82.4-88.1), respectively. These estimates were validated using a cohort study design.
Conclusions The test-negative design offers a feasible, robust method to estimate protection from prior infection in preventing reinfection.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the level and characteristics of protection from past SARS-CoV-2 infection against subsequent COVID-19 infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease is essential for predicting future potential disease burden and for designing policies that restrict, on the basis of immune status, travel or access to venues where there is a high risk of transmission.Methods: We systematically reviewed, identified, and extracted from the scientific literature studies that estimated the reduction in risk of COVID-19 among individuals with a past SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to those without a previous infection. We meta-analysed the effectiveness of past infection by outcome (infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease), variant, and time since infection. A Bayesian meta-regression has been run to estimate the pooled estimates of protection. The systematic review is PRISMA-compliant and is registered with PROSPERO.FindingsWe identified a total of 43 studies from 17 different countries. Our meta-analyses show that protection from recent infection and any symptomatic disease was high for ancestral, Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants but was substantially lower for the Omicron variant. Pooled effectiveness against reinfection by the Omicron variant was 38.8\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 31.5–46.3) and 43.7\% (18.4–74.4) against Omicron symptomatic disease. Mean pooled effectiveness was greater than 85\% against severe disease (hospitalisation and death) for all variants, including Omicron. Protection from reinfection from ancestral, Alpha, and Delta variants declined over time but remained at 78.2\% (38.9–95.1) at 40 weeks. Protection against reinfection by the Omicron variant declined more rapidly and was estimated at 29.0\% (10.4–64.4) at 40 weeks. There were not enough data to estimate protection against symptomatic disease and severe disease considering time since infection.Interpretation: Protection from past infection against reinfection from pre-Omicron variants was very high and remained high even after 40 weeks. Protection was substantially lower for the Omicron variant and declined more rapidly over time in comparison to previous variants. The immunity conferred by past infection should be weighed alongside protection from vaccination when assessing future disease burden from COVID-19 and when designing policies that mandate vaccination for workers or restrict access, on the basis of immune status, to settings where the risk of transmission is high, such as travel and high-occupancy indoor settings.Registration: The systematic review is PRISMA-compliant and is registered with PROSPERO.Funding: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, J.

	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa2114583},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite high vaccine coverage and effectiveness, the incidence of symptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been increasing in Israel. Whether the increasing incidence of infection is due to waning immunity after the receipt of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine is unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a 6-month longitudinal prospective study involving vaccinated health care workers who were tested monthly for the presence of anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Linear mixed models were used to assess the dynamics of antibody levels and to determine predictors of antibody levels at 6 months.
RESULTS: The study included 4868 participants, with 3808 being included in the linear mixed-model analyses. The level of IgG antibodies decreased at a consistent rate, whereas the neutralizing antibody level decreased rapidly for the first 3 months with a relatively slow decrease thereafter. Although IgG antibody levels were highly correlated with neutralizing antibody titers (Spearman's rank correlation between 0.68 and 0.75), the regression relationship between the IgG and neutralizing antibody levels depended on the time since receipt of the second vaccine dose. Six months after receipt of the second dose, neutralizing antibody titers were substantially lower among men than among women (ratio of means, 0.64; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.75), lower among persons 65 years of age or older than among those 18 to less than 45 years of age (ratio of means, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.48 to 0.70), and lower among participants with immunosuppression than among those without immunosuppression (ratio of means, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.20 to 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Six months after receipt of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, humoral response was substantially decreased, especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The future of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic hinges on virus evolution and duration of immune protection of natural infection against reinfection. We investigated duration of protection afforded by natural infection, the effect of viral immune evasion on duration of protection, and protection against severe reinfection, in Qatar, between February 28, 2020 and June 5, 2022.
METHODS Three national, matched, retrospective cohort studies were conducted to compare incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity among unvaccinated persons with a documented SARS-CoV-2 primary infection, to incidence among those infection-naïve and unvaccinated. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazard regression models.
RESULTS Effectiveness of pre-Omicron primary infection against pre-Omicron reinfection was 85.5\% (95\% CI: 84.8-86.2\%). Effectiveness peaked at 90.5\% (95\% CI: 88.4-92.3\%) in the 7th month after the primary infection, but waned to ∼70\% by the 16th month. Extrapolating this waning trend using a Gompertz curve suggested an effectiveness of 50\% in the 22nd month and {\textless}10\% by the 32nd month. Effectiveness of pre-Omicron primary infection against Omicron reinfection was 38.1\% (95\% CI: 36.3-39.8\%) and declined with time since primary infection. A Gompertz curve suggested an effectiveness of {\textless}10\% by the 15th month. Effectiveness of primary infection against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 reinfection was 97.3\% (95\% CI: 94.9- 98.6\%), irrespective of the variant of primary infection or reinfection, and with no evidence for waning. Similar results were found in sub-group analyses for those ≥50 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS Protection of natural infection against reinfection wanes and may diminish within a few years. Viral immune evasion accelerates this waning. Protection against severe reinfection remains very strong, with no evidence for waning, irrespective of variant, for over 14 months after primary infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has two main sub-lineages, BA.1 and BA.2 with significant genetic distance between them. This study investigated protection of infection with one sub-lineage against reinfection with the other sub-lineage in Qatar during a large BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron wave, from December 19, 2021 to February 21, 2022.
METHODS Two national matched, retrospective cohort studies were conducted to estimate effectiveness of BA.1 infection against reinfection with BA.2 (N=20,197; BA.1-against-BA.2 study), and effectiveness of BA.2 infection against reinfection with BA.1 (N=100,925; BA.2-against-BA.1 study). Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models.
RESULTS In the BA.1-against-BA.2 study, cumulative incidence of infection was estimated at 0.03\% (95\% CI: 0.01-0.07\%) for the BA.1-infected cohort and at 0.62\% (95\% CI: 0.51-0.75\%) for the uninfected-control cohort, 15 days after the start of follow-up. Effectiveness of BA.1 infection against reinfection with BA.2 was estimated at 94.9\% (95\% CI: 88.4-97.8\%). In the BA.2-against-BA.1 study, cumulative incidence of infection was estimated at 0.03\% (95\% CI: 0.02-0.04\%) for the BA.2-infected cohort and at 0.17\% (95\% CI: 0.15-0.21\%) for the uninfected-control cohort, 15 days after the start of follow-up. Effectiveness of BA.2 infection against reinfection with BA.1 was estimated at 85.6\% (95\% CI: 77.4-90.9\%).
CONCLUSIONS Infection with an Omicron sub-lineage appears to induce strong, but not full protection against reinfection with the other sub-lineage, for at least several weeks after the initial infection.},

	abstract = {Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is an extremely successful human herpes virus, which infects essentially all human beings at some time during their life span. EBV infection and the associated immune response results in production of antibodies (seroconversion), which occurs mainly during the first years of life, but may also happen during adolescence or later in life. Infection of adolescents can result in infectious mononucleosis, an acute serious condition characterized by massive lymphocytosis. Transmission of EBV mainly occurs through saliva but can rarely be spread through semen or blood, e.g. through organ transplantations and blood transfusions. EBV transmission through oral secretions results in infection of epithelial cells of the oropharynx. From the epithelial cells EBV can infect B cells, which are the major reservoir for the virus, but other cell types may also become infected. As a result, EBV can shuttle between different cell types, mainly B cells and epithelial cells. Moreover, since the virus can switch between a latent and a lytic life cycle, EBV has the ability to cause chronic relapsing/reactivating infections. Chronic or recurrent EBV infection of epithelial cells has been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj\"{o}gren’s syndrome, whereas chronic/recurrent infection of B cells has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and other diseases. Accordingly, since EBV can shuttle between epithelial cells and B cells, the systemic autoimmune diseases often occur as overlapping syndromes with symptoms and characteristic autoantibodies (e.g. antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors) reflecting epithelial and/or B cell infection.},

	abstract = {Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), originally discovered through its association with Burkitt lymphoma, is now aetiologically linked to a remarkably wide range of lymphoproliferative lesions and malignant lymphomas of B-, T- and NK-cell origin. Some occur as rare accidents of virus persistence in the B lymphoid system, while others arise as a result of viral entry into unnatural target cells. The early finding that EBV is a potent B-cell growth transforming agent hinted at a simple oncogenic mechanism by which this virus could promote lymphomagenesis. In reality, the pathogenesis of EBV-associated lymphomas involves a complex interplay between different patterns of viral gene expression and cellular genetic changes. Here we review recent developments in our understanding of EBV-associated lymphomagenesis in both the immunocompetent and immunocompromised host.

	abstract = {Despite myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) affecting millions of people worldwide, many clinicians lack the knowledge to appropriately diagnose or manage ME/CFS. Unfortunately, clinical guidance has been scarce, obsolete, or potentially harmful. Consequently, up to 91\% of patients in the United States remain undiagnosed, and those diagnosed often receive inappropriate treatment. These problems are of increasing importance because after acute COVID-19, a significant percentage of people remain ill for many months with an illness similar to ME/CFS. In 2015, the US National Academy of Medicine published new evidence-based clinical diagnostic criteria that have been adopted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, the United States and other governments as well as major health care organizations have recently withdrawn graded exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the treatment of choice for patients with ME/CFS. Recently, 21 clinicians specializing in ME/CFS convened to discuss best clinical practices for adults affected by ME/CFS. This article summarizes their top recommendations for generalist and specialist health care providers based on recent scientific progress and decades of clinical experience. There are many steps that clinicians can take to improve the health, function, and quality of life of those with ME/CFS, including those in whom ME/CFS develops after COVID-19. Patients with a lingering illness that follows acute COVID-19 who do not fully meet criteria for ME/CFS may also benefit from these approaches.},

	abstract = {Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a chronic multisystem disease characterized by a variety of symptoms, and exhibits various features of an autoimmune-like disease. Subtypes are well recognized but to date are difficult to identify objectively. The disease may be triggered by infection with a variety of micro-organisms, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A subset of CFS/ME patients exhibit up regulation of EBV virus induced gene 2 (EBI2) mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and these patients appear to have a more severe disease phenotype and lower levels of EBNA1 IgG. EBI2 is induced by EBV infection and has been found to be upregulated in a variety of autoimmune diseases. EBI2 is a critical gene in immunity and central nervous system function; it is a negative regulator of the innate immune response in monocytes. Its heterogeneous expression in CFS/ME could explain the variable occurrence of a variety of immune and neurological abnormalities which are encountered in patients with CFS/ME. The EBI2 subtype occurred in 38–55\% CFS/ME patients in our studies. Further work is required to confirm the role of EBV and of EBI2 and its oxysterol ligands in CFS/ME, and to identify the most practical means to identify patients of the EBI subtype. There are two EBI2 antagonists currently in development, and these may hold promise in the treatment of CFS/ME patients of the EBI subtype.},

	abstract = {Background A defined diagnostic panel differentiated patients who had been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), based upon Fukuda/Carruthers criteria. This diagnostic panel identified an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) subset of patients (6), excluding for the first time other similar “clinical” conditions such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, borreliosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and adult rheumatic fever, which may be mistakenly called CFS. CFS patients were treated with valacyclovir (14.3 mg/kg q6h) for ≥12 months. Each patient improved, based upon the Functional Activity Appraisal: Energy Index Score Healthcare Worker Assessment (EIPS), which is a validated (FSS-9), item scale with high degree of internal consistency measured by Cronbach's alpha. Methods Antibody to EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, EBV Diffuse Early Antigen EA(D), and neutralizing antibodies against EBV-encoded DNA polymerase and EBV-encoded dUTPase were assayed serially approximately every three months for 13–16 months from sera obtained from patients with CFS (6) and from sera obtained from twenty patients who had no history of CFS. Results Antibodies to EBV EA(D) and neutralizing antibodies against the encoded-proteins EBV DNA polymerase and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) were present in the EBV subset CFS patients. Of the sera samples obtained from patients with CFS 93.9\% were positive for EA(D), while 31.6\% of the control patients were positive for EBV EA(D). Serum samples were positive for neutralizing antibodies against the EBV-encoded dUTPase (23/52; 44.2\%) and DNA polymerase (41/52; 78.8\%) in EBV subset CFS patients, but negative in sera of controls. Conclusions There is prolonged elevated antibody level against the encoded proteins EBV dUTPase and EBV DNA polymerase in a subset of CFS patients, suggesting that this antibody panel could be used to identify these patients, if these preliminary findings are corroborated by studies with a larger number of EBV subset CFS patients.},

Based on the structural requirements for both MHC class II binding and TCR recognition of an immunodominant myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide, criteria for a data base search were developed in which the degeneracy of amino acid side chains required for MHC class II binding and the conservation of those required for T cell activation were considered. A panel of 129 peptides that matched the molecular mimicry motif was tested on seven MBP-specific T cell clones from multiple sclerosis patients. Seven viral and one bacterial peptide efficiently activated three of these clones. Only one peptide could have been identified as a molecular mimic by sequence alignment. The observation that a single T cell receptor can recognize quite distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.},

The authors have previously demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid T cells from multiple sclerosis patients recognize autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells. They now report that CD4+ T cells specific for the Epstein-Barr virus DNA polymerase peptide EBV 627-641 were present in the cerebrospinal fluid from one of two multiple sclerosis patients, and that a high proportion of these CD4+ T cells cross-recognized an immunodominant myelin basic protein peptide, MBP 85-99. In the observed patient, the proportion of EBV 627-641-specific CD4+ T cells seemed to exceed 1/10,000 in cerebrospinal fluid, compared to approximately 1/100,000 in blood. These findings prove that Epstein-Barr-virus specific CD4+ T cells can gain access to the intrathecal compartment, and suggest that Epstein-Barr virus-specific CD4+ T cells could target myelin basic protein in the central nervous system.},

We explored mechanisms leading to this change in EBV-specific immunity in untreated patients with MS and healthy virus carriers matched for MS-associated HLA alleles. MS patients showed selective increase of T cell responses to the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), the most consistently recognized EBV-derived CD4(+) T cell antigen in healthy virus carriers, but not to other EBV-encoded proteins. In contrast, influenza and human cytomegalovirus-specific immune control was unchanged in MS. The enhanced response to EBNA1 was mediated by an expanded reservoir of EBNA1-specific central memory CD4(+) T helper 1 (Th1) precursors and Th1 (but not Th17) polarized effector memory cells. In addition, EBNA1-specific T cells recognized myelin antigens more frequently than other autoantigens that are not associated with MS. Myelin cross-reactive T cells produced IFN-gamma, but differed from EBNA1-monospecific cells in their capability to produce interleukin-2, indicative of a polyfunctional phenotype as found in controlled chronic viral infections. Our data support the concept that clonally expanded EBNA1-specific CD4(+) T cells potentially contribute to the development of MS by cross-recognition of myelin antigens.},

We have previously identified increased autoantibody levels toward the chloride-channel protein Anoctamin 2 (ANO2) in MS. Here, IgG antibody reactivity toward ANO2 and EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) was measured using bead-based multiplex serology in plasma samples from 8,746 MS cases and 7,228 controls. We detected increased anti-ANO2 antibody levels in MS (P = 3.5 × 10-36) with 14.6\% of cases and 7.8\% of controls being ANO2 seropositive (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95\% confidence intervals [95\%CI]: 1.5 to 1.8). The MS risk increase in ANO2-seropositive individuals was dramatic when also exposed to 3 known risk factors for MS: HLA-DRB1*15:01 carriage, absence of HLA-A*02:01, and high anti-EBNA1 antibody levels (OR = 24.9; 95\%CI: 17.9 to 34.8). Reciprocal blocking experiments with ANO2 and EBNA1 peptides demonstrated antibody cross-reactivity, mapping to ANO2 [aa 140 to 149] and EBNA1 [aa 431 to 440]. HLA gene region was associated with anti-ANO2 antibody levels and HLA-DRB1*04:01 haplotype was negatively associated with ANO2 seropositivity (OR = 0.6; 95\%CI: 0.5 to 0.7). Anti-ANO2 antibody levels were not increased in patients from 3 other inflammatory disease cohorts. The HLA influence and the fact that specific IgG production usually needs T cell help provides indirect evidence for a T cell ANO2 autoreactivity in MS. We propose a hypothesis where immune reactivity toward EBNA1 through molecular mimicry with ANO2 contributes to the etiopathogenesis of MS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We consider effects of dependence among variables of high-dimensional data in multiple hypothesis testing problems, in particular the False Discovery Rate (FDR) control procedures. Recent simulation studies consider only simple correlation structures among variables, which is hardly inspired by real data features. Our aim is to systematically study effects of several network features like sparsity and correlation strength by imposing dependence structures among variables using random correlation matrices.
RESULTS: We study the robustness against dependence of several FDR procedures that are popular in microarray studies, such as Benjamin-Hochberg FDR, Storey's q-value, SAM and resampling based FDR procedures. False Non-discovery Rates and estimates of the number of null hypotheses are computed from those methods and compared. Our simulation study shows that methods such as SAM and the q-value do not adequately control the FDR to the level claimed under dependence conditions. On the other hand, the adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg procedure seems to be most robust while remaining conservative. Finally, the estimates of the number of true null hypotheses under various dependence conditions are variable.
CONCLUSION: We discuss a new method for efficient guided simulation of dependent data, which satisfy imposed network constraints as conditional independence structures. Our simulation set-up allows for a structural study of the effect of dependencies on multiple testing criterions and is useful for testing a potentially new method on pi0 or FDR estimation in a dependency context.},

We executed a deep multi-omic, longitudinal investigation of 309 COVID-19 patients from initial diagnosis to convalescence (2-3 months later), integrated with clinical data and patient-reported symptoms. We resolved four PASC-anticipating risk factors at the time of initial COVID-19 diagnosis: type 2 diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific auto-antibodies. In patients with gastrointestinal PASC, SARS-CoV-2-specific and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited unique dynamics during recovery from COVID-19. Analysis of symptom-associated immunological signatures revealed coordinated immunity polarization into four endotypes, exhibiting divergent acute severity and PASC. We find that immunological associations between PASC factors diminish over time, leading to distinct convalescent immune states. Detectability of most PASC factors at COVID-19 diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early disease measurements for understanding emergent chronic conditions and suggests PASC treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {Drug designing and development is an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative structure-activity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to protein-protein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of action.},

This hypothesis is based on data from other viral infections, including influenza viruses, HIV, hepatitis viruses, and others that have demonstrated sex-specific immunity to viral infections. Although males are more susceptible to most viral infections, females possess immunological features that render them more vulnerable to distinct immune-related disease outcomes. Both sex chromosome complement and related genes as well as sex steroids play important roles in mediating the development of sex differences in immunity to viral infections.},

However, evidence accumulated over the past few decades increasingly suggests that vaccines can also have non-specific effects on unrelated infections and diseases, with important implications for childhood mortality particularly in low-income settings. Furthermore, many of these non-specific effects, as well as the pathogen-specific effects, of vaccines show differences between the sexes. Here, members of the Optimmunize consortium discuss the evidence for and potential mechanisms of non-specific and sex-differential effects of vaccines, as well as their potential policy implications. Given that the non-specific effects of some vaccines are now being tested for their ability to protect against COVID-19, the authors also comment on the broader implications of these trials.},

	abstract = {Persistent infection by EBV is explained by the germinal center model (GCM) which provides a satisfying and currently the only explanation for EBVs disparate biology. Since the GCM touches on every aspect of the virus, this chapter will serve as an introduction to the subsequent chapters. EBV is B lymphotropic, and its biology closely follows that of normal mature B lymphocytes. The virus persists quiescently in resting memory B cells for the lifetime of the host in a non-pathogenic state that is also invisible to the immune response. To access this compartment, the virus infects naïve B cells in the lymphoepithelium of the tonsils and activates these cells using the growth transcription program. These cells migrate to the GC where they switch to a more limited transcription program, the default program, which helps rescue them into the memory compartment where the virus persists. For egress, the infected memory cells return to the lymphoepithelium where they occasionally differentiate into plasma cells activating viral replication. The released virus can either infect more naïve B cells or be amplified in the epithelium for shedding. This cycle of infection and the quiescent state in memory B cells allow for lifetime persistence at a very low level that is remarkably stable over time. Mathematically, this is a stable fixed point where the mechanisms regulating persistence drive the state back to equilibrium when perturbed. This is the GCM of EBV persistence. Other possible sites and mechanisms of persistence will also be discussed.},

These T cell clones also can be stimulated by arginine-enriched protein domains from other common viruses and recognize multiple autoantigens. Our data suggest that repeated infections with common pathogenic and even nonpathogenic viruses could expand T cells specific for conserved protein domains that are able to cross-react with tissue-derived and ubiquitous autoantigens.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jaut.2018.10.012},
	abstract = {Molecular mimicry is one of the leading mechanisms by which infectious or chemical agents may induce autoimmunity. It occurs when similarities between foreign and self-peptides favor an activation of autoreactive T or B cells by a foreign-derived antigen in a susceptible individual. However, molecular mimicry is unlikely to be the only underlying mechanism for autoimmune responses; other factors such as breach in central tolerance, non-specific bystander activation, or persistent antigenic stimuli (amongst others) may also contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. Host genetics, exposure to microbiota and environmental chemicals are additional links to our understanding of molecular mimicry. Our current knowledge of the detailed mechanisms of molecular mimicry is limited by the issues of prolonged periods of latency before the appearance of disease, the lack of enough statistical power in epidemiological studies, the limitations of the potential role of genetics in human studies, the relevance of inbred murine models to the diverse human population and especially the limited technology to systematically dissect the human T-cell repertoire and B-cell responses. Nevertheless, studies on the role of autoreactive T-cells that are generated secondary to molecular mimicry, the diversity of the T-cell receptor repertoires of auto-reactive T-cells, the role of exposure to cryptic antigens, the generation of autoimmune B-cell responses, the interaction of microbiota and chemical adjuvants with the host immune systems all provide clues in advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the evolving concept of molecular mimicry and also may potentially aid in the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is common in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD). This study compared symptom-related cognitions, beliefs, behaviours, quality of sleep, lack of acceptance and distress in participants with ARD such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SpA), and connective tissue disease (CTD), and participants with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
METHODS: 303 participants with RA, SpA, CTD and CFS completed questionnaire measures of fatigue, social adjustment, cognitive-behavioural responses, lack of acceptance, distress and quality of sleep. The RA, SpA and CTD groups were first compared with each other. They were then combined into one group and compared with the CFS group.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the RA, SpA or CTD groups for any of the measures. The CFS group was more fatigued, reported more distress and sleep disturbance and had worse social adjustment than the ARD group after adjustment for age and illness duration. After adjustment for fatigue, age, and illness duration, the CFS group scored more highly on lack of acceptance and avoidance/resting behaviour while the ARD group showed significantly higher levels of catastrophizing, damage beliefs, and symptom focusing than the CFS group.
CONCLUSION: Fatigue in rheumatic diseases may be perpetuated by similar underlying transdiagnostic processes. The ARD and CFS groups showed similarities but also key differences in their responses to symptoms. Specific aspects of treatment may need to be tailored towards each group. For example, lack of acceptance and avoidance behaviour may be particularly important in perpetuating fatigue in CFS.},

METHODS: Seventy-four RA patients and 49 CFS patients completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey.
RESULTS: When compared to the RA group, the CFS group attributed a wider range of everyday somatic symptoms to their illness, perceived the consequences of their illness to be more profound and were more likely to attribute their illness to a virus or immune system dysfunction. Both groups reported equivalent levels of physical disability but the CFS group reported significantly higher levels of role and social disability.
CONCLUSION: Although the symptoms of CFS are largely medically unexplained, CFS patients have more negative views about their symptoms and the impact that these have had on their lives than do patients with a clearly defined and potentially disabling medical condition. The data support the cognitive behavioural models of CFS that emphasise the importance of patients' illness perceptions in perpetuating this disorder.},

	abstract = {A protein undergoes many types of posttranslation modification. Citrullination is one of these modifications, where an arginine amino acid is converted to a citrulline amino acid. This process depends on catalytic enzymes such as peptidylarginine deiminase enzymes (PADs). This modification leads to a charge shift, which affects the protein structure, protein-protein interactions, and hydrogen bond formation, and it may cause protein denaturation. The irreversible citrullination reaction is not limited to a specific protein, cell, or tissue. It can target a wide range of proteins in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria. Citrullination is a normal reaction during cell death. Apoptosis is normally accompanied with a clearance process via scavenger cells. A defect in the clearance system either in terms of efficiency or capacity may occur due to massive cell death, which may result in the accumulation and leakage of PAD enzymes and the citrullinated peptide from the necrotized cell which could be recognized by the immune system, where the immunological tolerance will be avoided and the autoimmune disorders will be subsequently triggered. The induction of autoimmune responses, autoantibody production, and cytokines involved in the major autoimmune diseases will be discussed.},

The present report presents data showing that p107, the major epitope of the EBV-encoded EBNA-1 antigen, cross-reacts with denatured collagen (DC) and keratin (K), suggesting a new likely link among RA, EBV-1, and these autoantigens. A radioimmunoassay using antigen-coated microtiter plates was used to demonstrate antibodies in sera of patients with RA and sera of healthy donors against p107, DC, and K. Specificity of the antibodies was ascertained by inhibition tests with the homologous antigens. Cross-reactivity among anti-p107, anti-DC, and anti-K antibodies was assayed by the ability of a given antigen to block the binding of nonpurified or affinity-purified antibodies to plates coated with another antigen. Most of the sera contained antibodies to all three antigens, but only anti-DC antibodies were present in higher titers in RA sera. Preincubation of sera with p107 appreciably reduced their binding to plates coated with DC or K. On the other hand, preincubation with DC (in solution or bound to Sepharose) did not result in consistent reduction of anti-p107 titers. Tests with affinity-purified antibodies revealed the existence of two antibodies populations, one of which reacted preferentially with p107, the other with DC. The cross-reactivity of the anti-p107 antibodies with DC and K suggests that such antibodies, produced by RA patients following persistent stimulation with EBV, might react in vivo with collagen (and keratin) exposed in previously damaged areas and thus reinforce the disease process.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this paper is to review recent findings on inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO\&NS) pathways in chronic fatigue and somatization disorder.
RECENT FINDINGS: Activation of IO\&NS pathways is the key phenomenon underpinning chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): intracellular inflammation, with an increased production of nuclear factor kappa beta (NFkappabeta), cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS); and damage caused by O\&NS to membrane fatty acids and functional proteins. These IO\&NS pathways are induced by a number of trigger factors, for example psychological stress, strenuous exercise, viral infections and an increased translocation of LPS from gram-bacteria (leaky gut). The 'psychosomatic' symptoms experienced by CFS patients are caused by intracellular inflammation (aches and pain, muscular tension, fatigue, irritability, sadness, and the subjective feeling of infection); damage caused by O\&NS (aches and pain, muscular tension and fatigue); and gut-derived inflammation (complaints of irritable bowel). Inflammatory pathways (monocytic activation) are also detected in somatizing disorder.
SUMMARY: 'Functional' symptoms, as occurring in CFS and somatization, have a genuine organic cause, that is activation of peripheral and central IO\&NS pathways and gut-derived inflammation. The development of new drugs, aimed at treating those disorders, should target these IO\&NS pathways.},

	abstract = {More than 2 million people in the United States have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). We performed targeted, broad-spectrum metabolomics to gain insights into the biology of CFS. We studied a total of 84 subjects using these methods. Forty-five subjects (n = 22 men and 23 women) met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS by Institute of Medicine, Canadian, and Fukuda criteria. Thirty-nine subjects (n = 18 men and 21 women) were age- and sex-matched normal controls. Males with CFS were 53 (±2.8) y old (mean ± SEM; range, 21–67 y). Females were 52 (±2.5) y old (range, 20–67 y). The Karnofsky performance scores were 62 (±3.2) for males and 54 (±3.3) for females. We targeted 612 metabolites in plasma from 63 biochemical pathways by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry in a single-injection method. Patients with CFS showed abnormalities in 20 metabolic pathways. Eighty percent of the diagnostic metabolites were decreased, consistent with a hypometabolic syndrome. Pathway abnormalities included sphingolipid, phospholipid, purine, cholesterol, microbiome, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, riboflavin, branch chain amino acid, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial metabolism. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed diagnostic accuracies of 94\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 84–100\%] in males using eight metabolites and 96\% (95\% CI, 86–100\%) in females using 13 metabolites. Our data show that despite the heterogeneity of factors leading to CFS, the cellular metabolic response in patients was homogeneous, statistically robust, and chemically similar to the evolutionarily conserved persistence response to environmental stress known as dauer.},

The aim of the present study was to examine whether CFS is accompanied by an immune response to neoepitopes of a variety of modified lipids and proteins indicating damage caused by oxidative and nitrosative stress. Toward this end we examined serum antibodies to fatty acids (oleic, palmitic and myristic acid), by-products of lipid peroxidation, i.e. azelaic acid and malondialdehyde (MDA), acetylcholine, S-farnesyl-L-cysteine, and N-oxide modified amino-acids in 14 patients with CFS, 14 subjects with partial CFS and 11 normal controls. We found that the prevalences and mean values for the serum IgM levels directed against oleic, palmitic and myristic acid, MDA, azelaic acid, S-farnesyl-L-cysteine, and the N-oxide derivates, nitro-tyrosine, nitro-phenylalanine, nitro-arginine, nitro-tryptophan, and nitro-cysteinyl were significantly greater in CFS patients than in normal controls, whereas patients with partial CFS took up an intermediate position. There were significant and positive correlations between the serum IgM levels directed against fatty acids, MDA and azelaic acid and the above N-oxide-derivates and the severity of illness (as measured by the FibroFatigue scale) and symptoms, such as aches and pain, muscular tension and fatigue. The results show that CFS is characterized by an IgM-related immune response directed against disrupted lipid membrane components, by-products of lipid peroxidation, S-farnesyl-L-cysteine, and NO-modified amino-acids, which are normally not detected by the immune system but due to oxidative and nitrosative damage have become immunogenic.},

Autoantibodies against G-protein coupled receptors were shown to play a pathogenic role in several autoimmune diseases. Here, serum samples from a patient cohort from Berlin (n=268) and from Bergen with pre- and post-treatment samples from 25 patients treated within the KTS-2 rituximab trial were analysed for IgG against human α and β adrenergic, muscarinic (M) 1–5 acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, angiotensin, and endothelin receptors by ELISA and compared to a healthy control cohort (n=108). Antibodies against β2, M3 and M4 receptors were significantly elevated in CFS patients compared to controls. In contrast, levels of antibodies against α adrenergic, dopamine, serotonin, angiotensin, and endothelin receptors were not different between patients and controls. A high correlation was found between levels of autoantibodies and elevated IgG1–3 subclasses, but not with IgG4. Further patients with high β2 antibodies had significantly more frequently activated HLA-DR+ T cells and more frequently thyreoperoxidase and anti-nuclear antibodies. In patients receiving rituximab maintenance treatment achieving prolonged B-cell depletion, elevated β2 and M4 receptor autoantibodies significantly declined in clinical responder, but not in non-responder. We provide evidence that 29.5\% of patients with CFS had elevated antibodies against one or more M acetylcholine and β adrenergic receptors which are potential biomarkers for response to B-cell depleting therapy. The association of autoantibodies with immune markers suggests that they activate B and T cells expressing β adrenergic and M acetylcholine receptors. Dysregulation of acetylcholine and adrenergic signalling could also explain various clinical symptoms of CFS.},

ME/CFS is triggered by an infection in the majority of patients. Initial evidence for a potential role of natural regulatory autoantibodies (AAB) to beta-adrenergic (AdR) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M-AChR) in ME/CFS patients comes from a few studies.
METHODS: Here, we analyzed the correlations of symptom severity with levels of AAB to vasoregulative AdR, AChR and Endothelin-1 type A and B (ETA/B) and Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor in a Berlin cohort of ME/CFS patients (n = 116) by ELISA. The severity of disease, symptoms and autonomic dysfunction were assessed by questionnaires.
RESULTS: We found levels of most AABs significantly correlated with key symptoms of fatigue and muscle pain in patients with infection-triggered onset. The severity of cognitive impairment correlated with AT1-R- and ETA-R-AAB and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms with alpha1/2-AdR-AAB. In contrast, the patients with non-infection-triggered ME/CFS showed fewer and other correlations.
CONCLUSION: Correlations of specific AAB against G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) with symptoms provide evidence for a role of these AAB or respective receptor pathways in disease pathomechanism.},

	abstract = {Aim
The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and potential association between infection with different herpes viruses and multiple sclerosis (MS).
Methods
A systematic literature search was performed by finding relevant cross-sectional and case-control studies from a large online database. Heterogeneity, Odds ratio (OR), and corresponding 95\% Confidence interval (CI) were applied to all studies by meta-analysis and forest plots. The analysis was performed using Stata Software v.14.
Results
One hundred and thirty-four articles (289 datasets) were included in the meta-analysis, 128 (245 datasets) of which were case/control and the rest were cross-sectional. The pooled prevalence of all human herpes viruses among MS patients was 50\% (95\% CI: 45–55\%; I2 = 96.91\%). In subgroup analysis, the pooled prevalence of Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), Human herpes virus 7 (HHV-7), and Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) was 32\%, 52\%, 74\%, 41\%, 39\% 28\%, and 28\%, respectively. An association was found between infection with human herpes viruses and MS [summary OR 2.07 (95\% CI (1.80–2.37); I2 = 80\%)].
Conclusion
The results of the present study showed that EBV, VZV, and HHV-6 infection are associated with multiple sclerosis and can be considered as potential risk factors for MS. Although the exact molecular mechanism of the role of herpes viruses in the development of MS is still unknown, it seems that molecular mimicry, the release of autoreactive antibodies, and inflammation in the CNS following viral infection can be important factors in the induction of MS.},

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). Compared to other types of self-limiting myelin disorders, MS compartmentalizes and maintains chronic inflammation in the CNS. Even though the exact cause of MS is unclear, it is assumed that genetic and environmental factors play an important role in susceptibility to this disease. The progression of MS is triggered by certain environmental factors, such as viral infections. The most important viruses that affect MS are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), human endogenous retrovirus (HERV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV). These viruses all have latent stages that allow them to escape immune detection and reactivate after exposure to various stimuli. Furthermore, their tropism for CNS and immune system cells explains their possible deleterious function in neuroinflammation. In this study, the effect of viral infections on MS disease focuses on the details of viruses that can change the risk of the disease. Paying attention to the most recent articles on the role of SARS-CoV-2 in MS disease, laboratory indicators show the interaction of the immune system with the virus. Also, strategies to prevent viruses that play a role in triggering MS are discussed, such as EBV, which is one of the most important.},

Recent studies have provided compelling epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for a causal role of EBV in multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system and is thought to be triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by an infectious agent, with EBV as the lead candidate. How a ubiquitous virus that typically leads to benign latent infections can promote cancer and autoimmune disease in at-risk populations is not fully understood. Here we review the evidence that EBV is a causal agent for MS and how various risk factors may affect EBV infection and immune control. We focus on EBV contributing to MS through reprogramming of latently infected B lymphocytes and the chronic presentation of viral antigens as a potential source of autoreactivity through molecular mimicry. We consider how knowledge of EBV-associated cancers may be instructive for understanding the role of EBV in MS and discuss the potential for therapies that target EBV to treat MS.},

Possibly because the damage of the virus infection may occur before onset of clinical symptoms and because it has been difficult to detect active infection and separate serological responses to HHV-6A or 6B. Recent studies report that in MS patients the serological response against HHV-6A is increased whereas it is decreased against HHV-6B. This effect seems to be even more pronounced in MS patients prior to diagnosis and supports previous studies postulating a predomination for HHV-6A in MS disease and suggests that the infection is important at early stages of the disease. Furthermore, HHV-6A infection interacts with other factors suspected of modulating MS susceptibility and progression such as infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV), tobacco smoking, HLA alleles, UV irradiation and vitamin D levels.

	abstract = {Human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A or HHV-6B involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology has remained controversial mainly due to the lack of serological methods that can distinguish the two viruses. A novel multiplex serological assay measuring IgG reactivity against the immediate-early protein 1 from HHV-6A (IE1A) and HHV-6B (IE1B) was used in a MS cohort (8,742 persons with MS and 7,215 matched controls), and a pre-MS cohort (478 individuals and 476 matched controls) to investigate this further. The IgG response against IE1A was positively associated with MS (OR = 1.55, p = 9 × 10−22), and increased risk of future MS (OR = 2.22, p = 2 × 10−5). An interaction was observed between IE1A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody responses for MS risk (attributable proportion = 0.24, p = 6 × 10−6). In contrast, the IgG response against IE1B was negatively associated with MS (OR = 0.74, p = 6 × 10−11). The association did not differ between MS subtypes or vary with severity of disease. The genetic control of HHV-6A/B antibody responses were located to the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region and the strongest association for IE1A was the DRB1*13:01-DQA1*01:03-DQB1*06:03 haplotype while the main association for IE1B was DRB1*13:02-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:04. In conclusion a role for HHV-6A in MS etiology is supported by an increased serological response against HHV-6A IE1 protein, an interaction with EBV, and an association to HLA genes.},

	abstract = {Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) share similarities regarding their epidemiology, symptomatology and craniospinal physiology. Indeed, the cardinal feature of CFS, fatigue, is also a major factor in the symptomatology of the majority of MS patients. Recently, we have found that there is a significant reduction in the craniospinal compliance in MS which affects both the stiffness of the walls of the spinal canal and the walls of the cerebral venous system. This change in compliance brings about an alteration in the effectiveness of the pulse wave dampening in the craniospinal system. The result is an impedance mismatch between the cortical veins and their draining sinuses, leading to dilatation of these upstream veins. We deduce this dilatation can only be brought about by an increase in the pressure gradient between the vein lumen and the subarachnoid space (i.e. the transmural pressure gradient). We hypothesise that given the similarities between MS and CFS, a similar mechanism underlies the physiology of CFS. We present two case studies to highlight the expected findings in CFS patients if this hypothesis were proven to be correct.},

	abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease characterized by unexplained debilitating fatigue. Although the etiology is unknown, evidence supports immunological abnormalities, such as persistent inflammation and immune-cell activation, in a subset of patients. Since the interplay between inflammation and vascular alterations is well-established in other diseases, endothelial dysfunction has emerged as another player in ME/CFS pathogenesis. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) generates nitric oxide (NO) that maintains endothelial homeostasis. eNOS is activated by silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1), an anti-inflammatory protein. Despite its relevance, no study has addressed the Sirt1/eNOS axis in ME/CFS. The interest in circulating microRNAs (miRs) as potential biomarkers in ME/CFS has increased in recent years. Accordingly, we analyze a set of miRs reported to modulate the Sirt1/eNOS axis using plasma from ME/CFS patients. Our results show that miR-21, miR-34a, miR-92a, miR-126, and miR-200c are jointly increased in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls. A similar finding was obtained when analyzing public miR data on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Bioinformatics analysis shows that endothelial function-related signaling pathways are associated with these miRs, including oxidative stress and oxygen regulation. Interestingly, histone deacetylase 1, a protein responsible for epigenetic regulations, represented the most relevant node within the network. In conclusion, our study provides a basis to find endothelial dysfunction-related biomarkers and explore novel targets in ME/CFS.},

	abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease characterized by severe and persistent fatigue. Along with clinical studies showing endothelial dysfunction (ED) in a subset of ME/CFS patients, we have recently reported altered ED-related microRNAs in plasma from affected individuals. Inadequate nitric oxide (NO), mainly produced by the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in endothelial cells (ECs), is a major cause of ED. In this study, we hypothesized that plasma from that cohort of ME/CFS patients induces eNOS-related ED in vitro. To test this, we cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in the presence of plasma from either ME/CFS patients (ME/CFS-plasma, n = 11) or healthy controls (HC-plasma, n = 12). Then, we measured the NO production in the absence and presence of tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors agonists (TKRs and GPCRs, respectively), well-known to activate eNOS in ECs. Our data showed that HUVECs incubated with ME/CFS-plasma produced less NO either in the absence or presence of eNOS activators compared to ones in presence of HC-plasma. Also, the NO production elicited by bradykinin, histamine, and acetylcholine (GPCRs agonists) was more affected than the one triggered by insulin (TKR agonist). Finally, inhibitory eNOS phosphorylation at Thr495 was higher in HUVECs treated with ME/CFS-plasma compared to the same treatment with HC-plasma. In conclusion, this study in vitro shows a decreased NO production in HUVECs exposed to plasma from ME/CFS patients, suggesting an unreported role of eNOS in the pathophysiology of this disease.},

Here, we profiled antibody responses of patients with severe ME/CFS and healthy controls against microbiota and viral antigens represented as a phage-displayed 244,000 variant library. Patients with severe ME/CFS exhibited distinct serum antibody epitope repertoires against flagellins of Lachnospiraceae bacteria. Training machine learning algorithms on this antibody-binding data demonstrated that immune responses against gut microbiota represent a unique layer of information beyond standard blood tests, providing improved molecular diagnostics for ME/CFS. Together, our results point toward an involvement of the microbiota-immune axis in ME/CFS and lay the foundation for comparative studies with inflammatory bowel diseases and illnesses characterized by long-term fatigue symptoms, including post–COVID-19 syndrome.},

A Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) model initially based on 817 variables: two demographic, 34 blood analytic, 136 PBMC miRNAs, 639 Extracellular Vesicle (EV) miRNAs, and six EV features, selected an optimal number of five components, and a subset of 32 regressors showing statistically significant discriminant power. The presence of four EV-features (size and z-values of EVs prepared with or without proteinase K treatment) among the 32 regressors, suggested that blood vesicles carry relevant disease information. To further explore the features of ME/CFS EVs, we subjected them to Raman micro-spectroscopic analysis, identifying carotenoid peaks as ME/CFS fingerprints, possibly due to erythrocyte deficiencies. Although PLS-DA analysis showed limited capacity of Raman fingerprints for diagnosis (AUC = 0.7067), Raman data served to refine the number of PBMC miRNAs from our previous model still ensuring a perfect classification of subjects (AUC=1). Further investigations to evaluate model performance in extended cohorts of patients, to identify the precise ME/CFS EV components detected by Raman and to reveal their functional significance in the disease are warranted.},

Our group and others have explored the potential value of microRNA profiles (miRNomes) as diagnostic tools for this disease. However, heterogeneity of participants, low numbers, the variety of samples assayed, and other pre-analytical variables, have hampered the identification of  disease-associated miRNomes. In this study, our team has evaluated, for the first time, ME/CFS miRNomes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) from severely ill patients recruited at the monographic UK ME biobank to assess, using standard operating procedures (SOPs), blood fractions with optimal diagnostic power for a rapid translation of a miR-based diagnostic method into the clinic. Our results show that routine creatine kinase (CK) blood values, plasma EVs physical characteristics (including counts, size and zeta-potential), and a limited number of differentially expressed PBMC and EV miRNAs appear significantly associated with severe ME/CFS (p {\textless} 0.05). Gene enrichment analysis points to epigenetic and neuroimmune dysregulated pathways, in agreement with previous reports.

A few examples of these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle regression, random forests, and spline regression. Previous articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et al. (2006); Sinisi et al. (2007)) theoretically validated the use of cross validation to select an optimal learner among many candidate learners. Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions. This approach for construction of a super learner generalizes to any parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss function.},

The cause of MS is unknown, but immunological mechanisms are important. In MS, the pathological features include prominent demyelination and inflammation, but there is also evidence of neurodegeneration. Bladder symptoms are common in MS. The bladder is under neural control, and bladder disturbance is usually attributed to demyelination or loss of axons from the neural pathways, particularly those in the spinal cord, that control the bladder. However, as with other symptoms in MS, the presence of bladder disturbance does not always correlate well with MRI lesions. We speculate that other possible causes of bladder dysfunction in MS might include the effects of circulating toxic factors. Urgency of micturition is prominent in MS, and better understanding of the receptors involved in bladder sensation suggests possible treatment strategies through inhibiting these receptors.},

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and also is regarded as an autoimmune condition. However, the antigenic targets of the autoimmune response in MS have not yet been deciphered. In an effort to mine the autoantibody repertoire within MS, we profiled 2,169 plasma samples from MS cases and population-based controls using bead arrays built with 384 human protein fragments selected from an initial screening with 11,520 antigens. Our data revealed prominently increased autoantibody reactivity against the chloride-channel protein anoctamin 2 (ANO2) in MS cases compared with controls. This finding was corroborated in independent assays with alternative protein constructs and by epitope mapping with peptides covering the identified region of ANO2. Additionally, we found a strong interaction between the presence of ANO2 autoantibodies and the HLA complex MS-associated DRB1*15 allele, reinforcing a potential role for ANO2 autoreactivity in MS etiopathogenesis. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis in human MS brain tissue showed ANO2 expression as small cellular aggregates near and inside MS lesions. Thus this study represents one of the largest efforts to characterize the autoantibody repertoire within MS. The findings presented here demonstrate that an ANO2 autoimmune subphenotype may exist in MS and lay the groundwork for further studies focusing on the pathogenic role of ANO2 autoantibodies in MS.},

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogenous autoimmune disease in which autoreactive lymphocytes attack the myelin sheath of the central nervous system. B lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS contribute to inflammation and secrete oligoclonal immunoglobulins1,2. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection has been epidemiologically linked to MS, but its pathological role remains unclear3. Here we demonstrate high-affinity molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and the central nervous system protein glial cell adhesion molecule (GlialCAM) and provide structural and in vivo functional evidence for its relevance. A cross-reactive CSF-derived antibody was initially identified by single-cell sequencing of the paired-chain B cell repertoire of MS blood and CSF, followed by protein microarray-based testing of recombinantly expressed CSF-derived antibodies against MS-associated viruses. Sequence analysis, affinity measurements and the crystal structure of the EBNA1–peptide epitope in complex with the autoreactive Fab fragment enabled tracking of the development of the naive EBNA1-restricted antibody to a mature EBNA1–GlialCAM cross-reactive antibody. Molecular mimicry is facilitated by a post-translational modification of GlialCAM. EBNA1 immunization exacerbates disease in a mouse model of MS, and anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies are prevalent in patients with MS. Our results provide a mechanistic link for the association between MS and EBV and could guide the development of new MS therapies.},

	abstract = {Latent herpes virus reactivation has been demonstrated in astronauts during shuttle (10–16 days) and International Space Station (≥180 days) flights. Following reactivation, viruses are shed in the body fluids of astronauts. Typically, shedding of viral DNA is asymptomatic in astronauts regardless of mission duration; however, in some cases, live/infectious virus was recovered by tissue culture that was associated with atopic-dermatitis or skin lesions during and after spaceflight. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes activation during spaceflight occurs as indicated by increased levels of stress hormones including cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These changes, along with a decreased cell mediated immunity, contribute to the reactivation of latent herpes viruses in astronauts. Currently, 47/89 (53\%) astronauts from shuttle-flights and 14/23 (61\%) astronauts from ISS missions shed one or more herpes viruses in saliva/urine samples. Astronauts shed Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and herpes-simplex-1 (HSV-1) in saliva and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in urine. Larger quantities and increased frequencies for these viruses were found during spaceflight as compared to before or after flight samples and their matched healthy controls. The shedding did not abate during the longer ISS missions, but rather increased in frequency and amplitude. These findings coincided with the immune system dysregulation observed in astronauts from shuttle and ISS missions. VZV shedding increased from 41\% in space shuttle to 65\% in ISS missions, EBV increased 82 to 96\%, and CMV increased 47 to 61\%. In addition, VZV/CMV shed ≤30 days after ISS in contrast to shuttle where VZV/CMV shed up to 5 and 3 days after flight respectively. Continued shedding of infectious-virus post-flight may pose a potential risk for crew who may encounter newborn infants, sero-negative adults or any immunocompromised individuals on Earth. Therefore, developing spaceflight countermeasures to prevent viral reactivation is essential. Our spaceflight-developed technologies for saliva collection/rapid viral detection have been extended to include clinical applications including zoster patients, chicken pox, post-herpetic neuralgia, multiple sclerosis, and various neurological disorders. These protocols are employed in various clinics and hospitals including the CDC and Columbia University in New York, as well as overseas in Switzerland and Israel.},

	abstract = {The majority of adults are seropositive for human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). HHV-6 reactivation can occur after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and lead to life-threatening central nervous system disorders. In this prospective study, we evaluated the relationship between HHV-6 reactivation and anti-HHV-6 IgG antibody levels in recipients of allogeneic HSCT. The HHV-6 viral load in the plasma was quantitatively measured weekly after allogeneic HSCT by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The level of anti-HHV-6 IgG antibody was measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay before and serially after transplantation. In 28 of the 56 evaluated patients (50\%), HHV-6 reactivation was detected after transplantation. In a multivariate analysis, cord blood as the stem cell source was the only significant factor associated with HHV-6 reactivation (odds ratio, 8.6; 95\% confidence interval, 2.3 to 32.6; P {\textless} .01). When evaluated in the recipients of cord blood transplantation (CBT), the anti-HHV-6 antibody level before transplantation was significantly lower in the patients with HHV-6 reactivation compared with those without (sample positivity index: median, 2.04 [range, 0.95 to 5.98] versus 4.15 [range, 3.93 to 5.65]; P {\textless} .05). The anti-HHV-6 antibody level was significantly decreased at 3 months post-transplantation compared with before transplantation (P {\textless} .01). Such differences were not observed in other stem cell sources. Our results demonstrate that the low anti-HHV-6 antibody level before transplantation was associated with the reactivation of HHV-6 after CBT, and that the anti-HHV-6 antibody level was significantly decreased specifically after CBT. These results suggest that HHV-6-specific humoral immunity plays a role in HHV-6 reactivation after CBT.},

	abstract = {Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is defined as greater than 6 months of persistent fatigue that is experienced physically and cognitively. The cognitive symptoms are generally thought to be a mild cognitive impairment, but individuals with CFS subjectively describe them as “brain fog.” The impairment is not fully understood and often is described as slow thinking, difficulty focusing, confusion, lack of concentration, forgetfulness, or a haziness in thought processes. Causes of “brain fog” and mild cognitive impairment have been investigated. Possible physiological correlates may be due to the effects of chronic orthostatic intolerance (OI) in the form of the Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and decreases in cerebral blood flow (CBF). In addition, fMRI studies suggest that individuals with CFS may require increased cortical and subcortical brain activation to complete difficult mental tasks. Furthermore, neurocognitive testing in CFS has demonstrated deficits in speed and efficiency of information processing, attention, concentration, and working memory. The cognitive impairments are then perceived as an exaggerated mental fatigue. As a whole, this is experienced by those with CFS as “brain fog” and may be viewed as the interaction of physiological, cognitive, and perceptual factors. Thus, the cognitive symptoms of CFS may be due to altered CBF activation and regulation that are exacerbated by a stressor, such as orthostasis or a difficult mental task, resulting in the decreased ability to readily process information, which is then perceived as fatiguing and experienced as “brain fog.” Future research looks to further explore these interactions, how they produce cognitive impairments, and explain the perception of “brain fog” from a mechanistic standpoint.},

Brain fog is a colloquial term for a common complaint among patients with PASC and generally implies cognitive impairment in domains of attention and processing speed. There are multiple hypotheses for etiologies and explanations of mechanisms contributing to brain fog in PASC. In this paper, we describe some of the mechanisms associated with brain fog post COVID-19 and provide readers with treatment recommendations that encompass cognition, mood disorders, sleep disorders, and neuroinflammation.},

	abstract = {Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a highly prevalent neurotropic virus. Although on the whole, chronic, latent or persistent infection is considered to be relatively benign, HSV infections can cause cognitive impairment during and after acute encephalitis. Some studies have documented cognitive impairment in exposed persons that is untraceable to encephalitis. Most studies have focused on these impairments in the mentally ill, mostly among individuals with schizophrenia, and only recently have studies begun to examine the impact of HSV infection on the cognition of healthy individuals. Subjects were a representative, random sample of 612 soldiers before active duty in the Israeli military (Israeli defense force — IDF), 62.2\% HSV positive (n=381) and 38.8\% HSV negative (n=231). Cognitive functioning and language abilities were compared between these groups, controlling for years of education, immigration status, and gender. Compared to soldiers who were sero-negative, soldiers who were sero-positive for HSV had significantly lower IQ scores (IQ=97.96, SD=15.19 vs IQ=103.23, SD=14.23; p≤0.001, effect size (ES)=0.2), and significantly lower Hebrew language scores (ES=0.1, p≤0.01). The results remained significant after removing subjects with mild depression, anxiety or personality disorders. Although we could not control for socio-economic status directly, our findings indicate that infection with HSV-1 is associated with reduced cognitive functioning in healthy individuals. This finding adds to the growing number of studies in the schizophrenia literature and indicates that many research findings seemingly characteristic of schizophrenia are related to the association between HSV exposure and cognitive functioning in general, and are not illness specific.},

The aim of this study was to find out whether antibodies to different herpes viruses are prospectively associated with cognitive functioning in a general adolescent population. Methods This study was performed in TRAILS, a large prospective general population cohort (N = 1084, 54\% female, mean age 16.2 years (SD 0.6)). At age 16, immunoglobulin G antibodies against HSV1, HSV2, CMV and EBV were measured next to high sensitive C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP). Two years later, immediate memory and executive functioning were assessed using the 15 words task and the self ordered pointing task. Multiple linear regression analysis with bootstrapping was performed to study the association between viral infections and cognitive function, adjusting for gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and cannabis use. Results Presence of HSV1 antibodies was associated with memory function ((B = −0.272, 95\% CI = −0.556 to −0.016, p = 0.047)), while the association with executive functioning did not reach statistical significance (B = 0.560, 95\% CI is −0.053 to 1.184, p = 0.075). The level of HSV1 antibodies was associated with both memory function (B = −0.160, 95\% CI = −0.280 to −0.039, p = 0.014) and executive functioning (B = 0.296, 95\% CI = 0.011 to 0.578, p = 0.046). Other herpes viruses and hsCRP were not associated with cognitive functioning. Conclusions Both presence and level of HSV1 antibodies are prospectively associated with reduced cognitive performance in a large cohort of adolescents.},

Linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between pathogen seropositivity and cognitive impairment.Results. Among children, HSV-1 seropositivity was associated with lower reading and spatial reasoning test scores (β, −0.69; 95\% confidence interval [CI], −1.18 to −.21 and β, −0.82; 95\% CI, −1.29 to −.36, respectively).

CMV seropositivity was also associated with impaired learning and recall (OR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.14–1.80). Among older adults, HSV-1 seropositivity was associated with immediate memory impairment (OR, 3.26; 95\% CI, 1.68–6.32).Conclusions. Future studies examining the biological pathways by which herpesviruses influence cognitive impairment across the life course are warranted.},

	abstract = {Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) is a neuroinvasive virus capable of entering the brain which makes it a candidate pathogen for increasing risk of dementia. Previous studies are inconsistent in their findings regarding the link between HSV1 and dementia, therefore, we investigated how HSV1 relates to cognitive decline and dementia risk using data from a population-based study. We measured HSV1 immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies in serum collected between 2002 and 2005 from participants of the Rotterdam Study. We used linear regression to determine HSV1 in relation to change in cognitive performance during 2 consecutive examination rounds on average 6.5 years apart. Next, we determined the association of HSV1 with risk of dementia (until 2016) using a Cox regression model. We repeated analyses for Alzheimer’s disease. All models were adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and apolipoprotein E genotype. Of 1915 non-demented participants (mean age 71.3 years, 56.7\% women), with an average follow-up time of 9.1 years, 244 participants developed dementia (of whom 203 Alzheimer’s disease). HSV1 seropositivity was associated with decline in global cognition (mean difference of HSV1 seropositive vs seronegative per standard deviation decrease in global cognition − 0.16; 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI), − 0.26; − 0.07), as well as separate cognitive domains, namely memory, information processing, and executive function, but not motor function. Finally, HSV1 seropositivity was not associated with risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio 1.18, 95\% CI 0.83; 1.68), similar for Alzheimer’s disease. HSV1 is associated with cognitive decline but not with incident dementia in the general population. These data suggest HSV1 to be associated only with subtle cognitive disturbances but not with greater cognitive disorders that result in dementia.},

This meta-analysis was undertaken to determine the relationship of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) exposure and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia. A systematic search was performed for studies comparing the cognitive functioning of HSV-1 seropositive vs. seronegative persons with schizophrenia. The primary outcome was the standardized mean difference (SMD) in composite cognitive score using Hedges’ g. Secondary outcomes were SMDs in 9cognitive domains. Study heterogeneity was estimated using the I2 index and formal tests of heterogeneity using Cochran's Q. In a sample of 3516 individuals from 9 studies the SMD was negative for the composite score and all 9 domains indicating a significant deficit for seropositive individuals in 8 domains. The SMDs ranged from -0.11 (Working Memory) to -0.36 (Visual Spatial). Cochran's Q test indicated heterogeneity for one domain. The I2 index of heterogeneity was in the low -moderate range for all but one domain. Exposure to HSV-1 is associated with decreased cognitive functioning in schizophrenia. An increased understanding of HSV-1 exposure might lead to improved methods for the prevention and treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {A common characteristic among schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients is cognitive dysfunction, especially for memory and attention. Recent evidence has suggested that cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients could be associated with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection, due to the ability of HSV-1 to infect neurons in the temporal lobe, which plays a key role in the formation of memory and processing of sensory input. The objective of this review is to analyze the aggregate neuropsychological testing data from previous studies regarding the impact of HSV-1 infection on cognitive function in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A systematic literature search generated a total of 379 articles; 12 full-text case control and cross-sectional studies met the eligibility criteria to be included in the review. Pooled effects assessed the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) total scores and the three index scores for immediate memory, delayed memory, and attention in a random effects model. The overall effect for RBANS total score was in favor of the HSV-1 positive group (z = 3.10, p = 0.002). A statistically significant overall effect of cognitive impairment for memory and attention indices was in favor of HSV positive schizophrenia patients (z = 5.95 p {\textless} 0.00001). The findings from the meta-analysis suggest that serological evidence of HSV-1 infection has a significant impact on cognitive function with small to moderate effect sizes (−0.23 to −0.49), particularly affecting memory and attention, in schizophrenia and bipolar patients.},

	abstract = {Background The Clinical Understanding and Research Excellence in ME/CFS group (CureME) at the London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine has supported and undertaken studies in immunology, genetics, virology, clinical medicine, epidemiology and disability. It established the UK ME/CFS Biobank (UKMEB), which stores data and samples from three groups: participants with ME/CFS, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls. Patient and public involvement have played a central role from its inception. Aim To explore the views of participants with ME/CFS and MS on CureME research findings, dissemination and future biomedical research priorities. Method Five ME/CFS and MS focus groups were conducted at two UK sites. Discussions were transcribed and analysed thematically. Results A total of 28 UKMEB participants took part: 16 with ME/CFS and 12 with MS. Five themes emerged: (a) Seeking coherence: participants’ reactions to initial research findings; (b) Seeking acceptance: participants explore issues of stigma and validation; (c) Seeking a diagnosis: participants explore issues around diagnosis in their lives; (d) Seeking a better future: participants’ ideas on future research; and (e) Seeking to share understanding: participants’ views on dissemination. Focus groups perceived progress in ME/CFS and MS research in terms of “putting together a jigsaw” of evidence through perseverance and collaboration. Conclusion This study provides insight into the emotional, social and practical importance of research to people with MS and ME/CFS, suggesting a range of research topics for the future. Findings should inform biomedical research directions in ME/CFS and MS, adding patients’ voices to a call for a more collaborative research culture.},

It has been used as a treatment in cases of worsening multiple sclerosis (MS). Cy is currently used for patients whose disease is not controlled by beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate as well as those with rapidly worsening MS. The most commonly used regimens involve outpatient IV pulse therapy given with or without corticosteroids every 4 to 8 weeks. Side effects include nausea, headache, alopecia, pain, male and women infertility, bladder toxicity, and risk of malignancy. 
Previous studies suggest that cy is effective in patients in the earlier stages of disease, where inflammation predominates over degenerative processes. Given that early inflammatory events appear to correlate with later disability, a major question is whether strong anti-inflammatory drugs, such as cy, will have an impact on later degenerative changes if given early in the disease to halt inflammation.},

An increasing body of evidence from randomized clinical trials and real-world data suggest that rituximab is a highly effective alternative in both relapsing and progressive MS, with a low discontinuation rate, related to a good benefit/risk profile, and a good compliance. To date, the use of rituximab in patients with multiple sclerosis is not in accordance with the authorized product information (off-label use). However, the use of this medicine is widespread in several countries, and in some cases, it is the most commonly used disease-modifying drug for MS subtypes. This use could be officially recognized by national regulatory authorities, according to specific procedures, to ensure equal access for patients to a safe and effective option.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disease with high symptom burden, of unknown etiology, with no established treatment. We observed patients with long-standing ME/CFS who got cancer, and who reported improvement of ME/CFS symptoms after chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, forming the basis for this prospective trial.Materials and methods: This open-label phase II trial included 40 patients with ME/CFS diagnosed by Canadian criteria. Treatment consisted of six intravenous infusions of cyclophosphamide, 600–700 mg/m2, given at four-week intervals with follow-up for 18 months, extended to 4 years. Response was defined by self-reported improvements in symptoms by Fatigue score, supported by Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores, physical activity measures and other instruments. Repeated measures of outcome variables were assessed by General linear models. Responses were correlated with specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles.Results: The overall response rate by Fatigue score was 55.0\% (22 of 40 patients). Fatigue score and other outcome variables showed significant improvements compared to baseline. The SF-36 Physical Function score increased from mean 33.0 at baseline to 51.5 at 18 months (all patients), and from mean 35.0 to 69.5 among responders. Mean steps per 24 h increased from mean 3,199 at baseline to 4,347 at 18 months (all patients), and from 3,622 to 5,589 among responders. At extended follow-up to 4 years 68\% (15 of 22 responders) were still in remission. Patients positive for HLA-DQB1*03:03 and/or HLA-C*07:04 (n = 12) had significantly higher response rate compared to patients negative for these alleles (n = 28), 83 vs. 43\%, respectively. Nausea and constipation were common grade 1–2 adverse events. There were one suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (aggravated POTS) and 11 serious adverse events in eight patients.Conclusion: Intravenous cyclophosphamide treatment was feasible for ME/CFS patients and associated with an acceptable toxicity profile. More than half of the patients responded and with prolonged follow-up, a considerable proportion of patients reported ongoing remission. Without a placebo group, clinical response data must be interpreted with caution. We nevertheless believe a future randomized trial is warranted.Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02444091.},

A subset of them fulfills diagnostic criteria of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Symptom severity of ME/CFS correlates with natural regulatory autoantibody (AAB) levels targeting several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). In this exploratory study, we analyzed serum AAB levels against vaso- and immunoregulatory receptors, mostly GPCRs, in 80 PCS patients following mild-to-moderate COVID-19, with 40 of them fulfilling diagnostic criteria of ME/CFS. Healthy seronegative (n=38) and asymptomatic post COVID-19 controls (n=40) were also included in the study as control groups. We found lower levels for various AABs in PCS compared to at least one control group, accompanied by alterations in the correlations among AABs. Classification using random forest indicated AABs targeting ADRB2, STAB1, and ADRA2A as the strongest classifiers (AABs stratifying patients according to disease outcomes) of post COVID-19 outcomes. Several AABs correlated with symptom severity in PCS groups. Remarkably, severity of fatigue and vasomotor symptoms were associated with ADRB2 AAB levels in PCS/ME/CFS patients. Our study identified dysregulation of AAB against various receptors involved in the autonomous nervous system (ANS), vaso-, and immunoregulation and their correlation with symptom severity, pointing to their role in the pathogenesis of PCS.},

A survey was administered to 214 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to measure quality of life, health status, disability, and employment. Measures of health-care costs and adherence to DMAs were constructed using claims data. The relationship between DMA adherence and outcomes was evaluated using generalized estimating equation methods, adjusting for patient sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, medication on hand at the time of the survey, insurance status, prescription copay, and duration of disease. A total of 163 patients (76\%) responded to the survey, of whom 111 had been dispensed a DMA. Mean adherence in the 12-month period preceding the survey was 78.1\%. Patients with higher adherence had better mental health and pain interference scores. Increasing adherence was also associated with a greater likelihood of employment and lower Expanded Disability Status Scale score. These findings illustrate the potential for improved outcomes among RRMS patients who adhere to DMA regimens and highlight the importance of considering medication adherence when evaluating DMA use and outcomes in practice.},

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and potentially highly disabling disorder with considerable social impact and economic consequences. It is the major cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. The social costs associated with MS are high because of its long duration, the early loss of productivity, the need for assistance in activities of daily living and the use of immunomodulatory treatments and multidisciplinary health care. Available MS epidemiological estimates are aimed at providing a measure of the disease burden in Europe. The total estimated prevalence rate of MS for the past three decades is 83 per 100 000 with higher rates in northern countries and a female:male ratio around 2.0. Prevalence rates are higher for women for all countries considered. The highest prevalence rates have been estimated for the age group 35–64 years for both sexes and for all countries. The estimated European mean annual MS incidence rate is 4.3 cases per 100 000. The mean distribution by disease course and by disability is also reported. Despite the wealth of epidemiological data on MS, comparing epidemiological indices among European countries is a hard task and often leads only to approximate estimates. This represents a major methodological concern when evaluating the MS burden in Europe and when implementing specific cost-of-illness studies.},

A distinctive symptom of patients with long COVID is post-exertional malaise, which is associated with a worsening of fatigue- and pain-related symptoms after acute mental or physical exercise, but its underlying pathophysiology is unclear. With this longitudinal case-control study (NCT05225688), we provide new insights into the pathophysiology of post-exertional malaise in patients with long COVID. We show that skeletal muscle structure is associated with a lower exercise capacity in patients, and local and systemic metabolic disturbances, severe exercise-induced myopathy and tissue infiltration of amyloid-containing deposits in skeletal muscles of patients with long COVID worsen after induction of post-exertional malaise. This study highlights novel pathways that help to understand the pathophysiology of post-exertional malaise in patients suffering from long COVID and other post-infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Background Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is characterized by unexplained fatigue that lasts for at least 6 months alongside a constellation of other symptoms. CFS was historically thought to be most common among White women of higher socio-economic status. However, some recent studies in the USA suggest that the prevalence is actually higher in some minority ethnic groups. If there are convincing differences in prevalence and risk factors across all or some ethnic groups, investigating the causes of these can help unravel the pathophysiology of CFS.Methods A systematic review was conducted to explore the relationship between fatigue, chronic fatigue (CF—fatigue lasting for 6 months), CFS and ethnicity. Studies were population-based and health service-based. Meta-analysis was also conducted to examine the population prevalence of CF and CFS across ethnic groups.Results Meta-analysis showed that compared with the White American majority, African Americans and Native Americans have a higher risk of CFS [Odds Ratio (OR) 2.95, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.69–10.4; OR = 11.5, CI: 1.1–56.4, respectively] and CF (OR = 1.56, CI: 1.03–2.24; OR = 3.28, CI: 1.63–5.88, respectively). Minority ethnic groups with CF and CFS experience more severe symptoms and may be more likely to use religion, denial and behavioural disengagement to cope with their condition compared with the White majority.Conclusions Although available studies and data are limited, it does appear that some ethnic minority groups are more likely to suffer from CF and CFS compared with White people. Ethnic minority status alone is insufficient to explain ethnic variation of prevalence. Psychosocial risk factors found in high-risk groups and ethnicity warrant further investigation to improve our understanding of aetiology and the management of this complex condition.},

A convenience sample of 110 persons with CFS completed the quality of life index and CFS questionnaire, and a subset of 22 persons were interviewed regarding their lived experience with CFS.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic illness may reshape not only the life of the ill parent but also that of the entire family, but research in this area remains limited. More specifically, little is known about how an ill parent and the family respond to a particularly devastating and controversial chronic illness, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the responses of the parent and the ensuing family system responses to the presence of chronic fatigue syndrome as a chronic parental illness.
METHODS: Parents were interviewed individually, and then the ill parent and as many immediate family members as possible were interviewed collectively. After consent or assent, interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Thematic analyses at the individual, intrafamily, and across-family levels were used to explore these phenomena.
RESULTS: Eight ill parents first described the onset of illness, an ongoing struggle to receive diagnosis and care, and the significance of the illness in transforming present and future roles. Multiple members of the family together with the ill parent described how they struggled with the reality of the illness, the shifting roles and responsibilities, the reduced family income, and the frequent social isolation that could be exacerbated by the controversial nature of the illness. Families described and demonstrated their struggles to maintain normal family life and plans in the face of continuing uncertainty.
DISCUSSION: This study is situated within current scholarship on family responses to chronic parental illness. The value of the family research interview is affirmed. Recommendations are made for future directions in family nursing research exploring responses of families in which a parent is chronically ill.},

	abstract = {A record of fifty-three patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department of the Royal Free Hospital between April 1955 and September 1957 suffering from ‘epidemic neuromyasthenia’ establishes the fact that the condition was endemic in the general population before, during and after the outbreak among the staff of the hospital. A further outbreak occurred in North Finchley between 1964 and 1967 and sporadic new cases are still being encountered. The majority of these patients show evidence of involvement of the central and sympathetic nervous systems and the reticulo-endothelial system. Abnormal muscular fatigability is the dominant clinical feature and it is suggested that mitochondrial damage may provide an explanation for this phenomenon. Enzyme tests carried out in seven cases show pathologically high levels of lactic dehydrogenase, and glutamic oxalo-acetic transaminase. A follow-up study suggests that there is one group of patients that recovers completely or nearly completely, a second that recovers but is subject to relapses and a third that shows little or no recovery, these patients remaining incapacitated.},

	abstract = {This is a comprehensive literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). We provide a description of the background, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management regarding CFS. CFS is a multifaceted illness that has many symptoms and a wide array of clinical presentations. As of recent, CFS has been merged with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Much of the difficulty in its management has stemmed from a lack of a concrete understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis. There is a potential association between dysfunction of the autoimmune, neuroendocrine, or autonomic nervous systems and the development of CFS. Possible triggering events, such as infections followed by an immune dysregulation resulting have also been proposed. In fact, ME/CFS was first described following Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infections, but it was later determined that it was not always preceded by EBV infection. Patient diagnosed with CFS have shown a noticeably earlier activation of anaerobic metabolism as a source of energy, which is suggestive of impaired oxygen consumption. The differential diagnoses range from tick-borne illnesses to psychiatric disorders to thyroid gland dysfunction. Given the many overlapping symptoms of CFS with other illnesses makes diagnosing it far from an easy task. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers it a diagnosing of exclusion, stating that self-reported fatigue for at minimum of six months and four of the following symptoms are necessary for a proper diagnosis: memory problems, sore throat, post-exertion malaise, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, myalgia, multi-joint pain, headaches, and troubled sleep. In turn, management of CFS is just as difficult. Treatment ranges from conservative, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressants, to minimally invasive management. Minimally invasive management involving ranscutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation of target points has demonstrated significant improvement in fatigue and associated symptoms in a 2017 randomized controlled study. The understanding of CFS is evolving before us as we continue to learn more about it. As further reliable studies are conducted, providing a better grasp of what the syndrome encompasses, we will be able to improve our diagnosis and management of it.},

The selection of diagnostic signs and symptoms has major implications for which individuals are diagnosed with CFS and how seriously the illness is viewed by health care providers, disability insurers and rehabilitation planners, and patients and their families and friends. Diagnostic criteria also have implications for whether research based on varying definitions can be synthesized. The current investigation examined differences between CFS as defined by Fukuda et al. (1994) and a set of criteria that has been proposed for a clinical Canadian Case definition. There were twenty-three participants who met the Canadian criteria, 12 in the CFS (Fukuda et al. (7) criteria) group and the 33 from the chronic fatigue (CF)-psychiatric group. Dependent measures included: work status, psychiatric comorbidity, symptoms, and functional impairment (measured by the Medical Outcomes Study). People meeting the Fukuda et al. and Canadian criteria were compared with people who had a chronically fatiguing illness explained by a psychiatric condition. Statistical tests used included binomial logistic regression and analysis of variance. The Canadian criteria group, in contrast to the Fukuda et al. criteria group, had more variables that statistically significantly differentiated them from the psychiatric comparison group. Overall, there were 17 symptom differences between the Canadian and CF-psychiatric group, but only 7 symptom differences between the CFS and CF-psychiatric group. The findings suggest that both the Canadian and Fukuda et al. case definitions select individuals who are statistically significantly different from psychiatric controls with chronic fatigue, with the Canadian criteria selecting cases with less psychiatric co-morbidity, more physical functional impairment, and more fatigue/weakness, neuropsychiatric, and neurological symptoms.},

However, it is unclear whether one infectious agent might be the cause or whether there might be many different infectious agents. The objective of this study was to identify self-reported infectious illnesses associated with the onset of ME/CFS.
METHODS: The present study involved data from multiple sites in several countries. 1773 individuals diagnosed with either ME, CFS or ME/CFS provided qualitative data concerning infectious triggers which were coded and classified for analysis.
RESULTS: 60.3\% of patients report a variety of infectious illnesses some time before onset of ME/CFS. The most frequently reported infectious illness was Mononucleosis, which occurred in 30\% of infections. However, over 100 other infectious illnesses were mentioned.
DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that many infectious agents might be associated with the onset of ME/CFS.},

The incidence of MS is increasing worldwide, together with the socioeconomic impact of the disease. The underlying cause of MS and mechanisms behind this increase remain opaque, although complex gene-environment interactions almost certainly play a significant role. The epidemiology of MS indicates that low serum levels of vitamin D, smoking, childhood obesity and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus are likely to play a role in disease development. Changes in diagnostic methods and criteria mean that people with MS can be diagnosed increasingly early in their disease trajectory. Alongside this, treatments for MS have increased exponentially in number, efficacy and risk. There is now the possibility of a diagnosis of 'pre-symptomatic MS' being made; as a result potentially preventive strategies could be studied. In this comprehensive review, MS epidemiology, potential aetiological factors and pathology are discussed, before moving on to clinical aspects of MS diagnosis and management.},

	abstract = {Techniques of data mining and machine learning were applied to a large database of medical and facility claims from commercially insured patients to determine the prevalence, gender demographics, and costs for individuals with provider-assigned diagnosis codes for myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The frequency of diagnosis was 519-1,038/100,000 with the relative risk of females being diagnosed with ME or CFS compared to males 1.238 and 1.178, respectively. While the percentage of women diagnosed with ME/CFS is higher than the percentage of men, ME/CFS is not a "women's disease." Thirty-five to forty percent of diagnosed patients are men. Extrapolating from this frequency of diagnosis and based on the estimated 2017 population of the United States, a rough estimate for the number of patients who may be diagnosed with ME or CFS in the U.S. is 1.7 million to 3.38 million. Patients diagnosed with CFS appear to represent a more heterogeneous group than those diagnosed with ME. A machine learning model based on characteristics of individuals diagnosed with ME was developed and applied, resulting in a predicted prevalence of 857/100,000 (p {\textgreater} 0.01), or roughly 2.8 million in the U.S. Average annual costs for individuals with a diagnosis of ME or CFS were compared with those for lupus (all categories) and multiple sclerosis (MS), and found to be 50\% higher for ME and CFS than for lupus or MS, and three to four times higher than for the general insured population. A separate aspect of the study attempted to determine if a diagnosis of ME or CFS could be predicted based on symptom codes in the insurance claims records. Due to the absence of specific codes for some core symptoms, we were unable to validate that the information in insurance claims records is sufficient to identify diagnosed patients or suggest that a diagnosis of ME or CFS should be considered based solely on looking for presence of those symptoms. These results show that a prevalence rate of 857/100,000 for ME/CFS is not unreasonable; therefore, it is not a rare disease, but in fact a relatively common one.},

While many pediatricians and other health-care providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS, provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and manage the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, lightheadedness, and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1 to 0.5\%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance (OI) are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, OI and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to estimate sex- and age-specific incidence rates of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) using population-based registry data. CFS/ME is a debilitating condition with large impact on patients and their families. The etiology is unknown, and the distribution of the disease in the general population has not been well described.
METHODS: Cases of CFS/ME were identified in the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR) for the years 2008 to 2012. The NPR is nationwide and contains diagnoses assigned by specialist health care services (hospitals and outpatient clinics). We estimated sex- and age-specific incidence rates by dividing the number of new cases of CFS/ME in each category by the number of person years at risk. Incidence rate ratios were estimated by Poisson regression with sex, age categories, and year of diagnosis as covariates.
RESULTS: A total of 5,809 patients were registered with CFS/ME during 2008 to 2012. The overall incidence rate was 25.8 per 100,000 person years (95\% confidence interval (CI): 25.2 to 26.5). The female to male incidence rate ratio of CFS/ME was 3.2 (95\% CI: 3.0 to 3.4). The incidence rate varied strongly with age for both sexes, with a first peak in the age group 10 to 19 years and a second peak in the age group 30 to 39 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Early etiological clues can sometimes be gained from examination of disease patterns. The strong female preponderance and the two age peaks suggest that sex- and age-specific factors may modulate the risk of CFS/ME.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and incidence of chronic fatigue syndrome in Olmsted County, Minnesota, using the 1994 case definition and describe exclusionary and comorbid conditions observed in patients who presented for evaluation of long-standing fatigue.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of potential cases of chronic fatigue syndrome identified from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2002, using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a population-based database. Patients were classified as having chronic fatigue syndrome if the medical record review documented fatigue of 6 months' duration, at least 4 of 8 chronic fatigue syndrome-defining symptoms, and symptoms that interfered with daily work or activities. Patients not meeting all of the criteria were classified as having insufficient/idiopathic fatigue.
RESULTS: We identified 686 potential patients with chronic fatigue, 2 of whom declined consent for medical record review. Of the remaining 684 patients, 151 (22\%) met criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome or insufficient/idiopathic fatigue. The overall prevalence and incidence of chronic fatigue syndrome and insufficient/idiopathic fatigue were 71.34 per 100,000 persons and 13.16 per 100,000 person-years vs 73.70 per 100,000 persons and 13.58 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The potential cases included 482 patients (70\%) who had an exclusionary condition, and almost half the patients who met either criterion had at least one nonexclusionary comorbid condition.
CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome and insufficient/idiopathic fatigue are relatively low in Olmsted County. Careful clinical evaluation to identify whether fatigue could be attributed to exclusionary or comorbid conditions rather than chronic fatigue syndrome itself will ensure appropriate assessment for patients without chronic fatigue syndrome.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent scientific findings have reinvigorated interest in examining the role of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory central nervous system neurotransmitter, in chronic pain conditions. Decreased inhibitory neurotransmission is a proposed mechanism in the pathophysiology of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia (FM). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that decreased levels of insular and anterior cingulate GABA would be present in FM patients, and that the concentration of this neurotransmitter would be correlated with pressure-pain thresholds.
METHODS: Sixteen FM patients and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent pressure-pain testing and a 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy session in which the right anterior insula, right posterior insula, anterior cingulate, and occipital cortex were examined in subjects at rest.
RESULTS: GABA levels in the right anterior insula were significantly lower in FM patients compared with healthy controls (mean ± SD 1.17 ± 0.24 arbitrary institutional units versus 1.42 ± 0.32 arbitrary institutional units; P = 0.016). There was a trend toward increased GABA levels in the anterior cingulate of FM patients compared with healthy controls (P = 0.06). No significant differences between groups were detected in the posterior insula or occipital cortex (P {\textgreater} 0.05 for all comparisons). Within the right posterior insula, higher levels of GABA were positively correlated with pressure-pain thresholds in the FM patients (Spearman's rho = 0.63; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Diminished inhibitory neurotransmission resulting from lower concentrations of GABA within the right anterior insula may play a role in the pathophysiology of FM and other central pain syndromes.},

These hypotheses have gained credence mostly because many of these diseases appear or fluctuate when there are hormonal changes such as in late adolescence and pregnancy.

	doi = {10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.10.018},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is associated to infections and it has been suggested that vaccination can trigger the disease. However, little is known about the specific association between clinically manifest influenza/influenza vaccine and CFS/ME. As part of a registry surveillance of adverse effects after mass vaccination in Norway during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, we had the opportunity to estimate and contrast the risk of CFS/ME after infection and vaccination.
METHODS: Using the unique personal identification number assigned to everybody who is registered as resident in Norway, we followed the complete Norwegian population as of October 1, 2009, through national registries of vaccination, communicable diseases, primary health, and specialist health care until December 31, 2012. Hazard ratios (HRs) of CFS/ME, as diagnosed in the specialist health care services (diagnostic code G93.3 in the International Classification of Diseases, Version 10), after influenza infection and/or vaccination were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of CFS/ME was 2.08 per 100,000 person-months at risk. The adjusted HR of CFS/ME after pandemic vaccination was 0.97 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-1.04), while it was 2.04 (95\% CI: 1.78-2.33) after being diagnosed with influenza infection during the peak pandemic period.
CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection was associated with a more than two-fold increased risk of CFS/ME. We found no indication of increased risk of CFS/ME after vaccination. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby symptomatic infection, rather than antigenic stimulation may trigger CFS/ME.},

Human herpesviruses are distributed worldwide, and more than 90\% of adults are infected by one or multiple HHVs. The HHV family contains three sub-families: the alpha sub-family [herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)], beta sub-family [human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), HHV6, and HHV7)], and gamma sub-family [Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV)]. All the viruses typically establish latent infection in host, and undergo lytic reactivation in certain pathophysiological conditions. In this issue, we collectively present ten articles focusing on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and interventions of HSV-1, VZV, HCMV, EBV and KSHV respectively, and these high-quality review and research articles are contributed by experts on those specific viruses.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a chronic condition that predominantly affects women. To date, there are few epidemiologic studies on CFS in men. The objective of the study was to assess whether there are gender-related differences in CFS, and to define a clinical phenotype in men.
Patients and methods
A prospective, cross-sectional cohort study was conducted including CFS patients at the time of diagnosis. Sociodemographic data, clinical variables, comorbid phenomena, fatigue, pain, anxiety/depression, and health quality of life, were assessed in the CFS population. A comparative study was also conducted between genders.
Results
The study included 1309 CFS patients, of which 119 (9.1\%) were men. The mean age and symptoms onset were lower in men than women. The subjects included 30\% single men vs 15\% single women, and 32\% of men had specialist work vs 20\% of women. The most common triggering factor was an infection. Widespread pain, muscle spasms, dizziness, sexual dysfunction, Raynaud's phenomenon, morning stiffness, migratory arthralgias, drug and metals allergy, and facial edema were less frequent in men. Fibromyalgia was present in 29\% of men vs 58\% in women. The scores on physical function, physical role, and overall physical health of the SF-36 were higher in men. The sensory and affective dimensions of pain were lower in men.
Conclusions
The clinical phenotype of the men with CFS was young, single, skilled worker, and infection as the main triggering agent. Men had less pain and less muscle and immune symptoms, fewer comorbid phenomena, and a better quality of life.
Resumen
Antecedentes y objetivo
El síndrome de fatiga crónica (SFC) es una entidad que afecta predominantemente a las mujeres, con escasos estudios epidemiológicos en los hombres. El objetivo fue evaluar si existen diferencias de género en el SFC y definir el perfil clínico en el hombre.
Pacientes y método
Estudio de cohorte transversal prospectivo de inclusión de pacientes con SFC en el momento del diagnóstico. Se evaluaron datos sociodemográficos, clínicos, fenómenos comórbidos y evaluación de la fatiga, dolor, ansiedad/depresión y calidad de vida a través de cuestionarios. Se realizó un estudio comparativo de las variables entre género.
Resultados
Se estudió a un total de 1.309 pacientes con SFC, de los cuales 119 (9,1\%) fueron hombres. La edad media y de inicio de los síntomas de los hombres fueron menores que en las mujeres. El 30\% eran hombres solteros, vs el 15\% de mujeres, y el 32\% tenían un trabajo especializado vs el 20\% en mujeres. El desencadenante más frecuente fue el infeccioso. El dolor generalizado, las contracturas musculares, los mareos, la disfunción sexual, el fenómeno de Raynaud, la rigidez matutina, las artralgias migratorias, las alergias a fármacos y metales, así como el edema facial, fueron menos frecuentes en los hombres. Se presentó fibromialgia en 29\% de los hombres vs 58\% de las mujeres. Los fenómenos comórbidos fueron menos frecuentes en los hombres. Las puntuaciones en la función física, el rol físico y la salud física global del SF-36 fueron más altas en los hombres. Las dimensiones sensorial y afectiva del dolor fueron inferiores en los hombres.
Conclusiones
El perfil clínico del hombre fue el de un paciente más joven, soltero, con trabajo especializado y con un desencadenante infeccioso. Los hombres presentaron menor dolor, menor sintomatología muscular e inmune, menor número de fenómenos comórbidos y mejor calidad de vida.},

	abstract = {The etiology of autoimmune diseases is multifactorial: genetic, environmental, hormonal, and immunological factors are all considered important in their development. Nevertheless, the onset of at least 50\% of autoimmune disorders has been attributed to "unknown trigger factors". Physical and psychological stress has been implicated in the development of autoimmune disease, since numerous animal and human studies demonstrated the effect of sundry stressors on immune function. Moreover, many retrospective studies found that a high proportion (up to 80\%) of patients reported uncommon emotional stress before disease onset. Unfortunately, not only does stress cause disease, but the disease itself also causes significant stress in the patients, creating a vicious cycle. Recent reviews discuss the possible role of psychological stress, and of the major stress-related hormones, in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. It is presumed that the stress-triggered neuroendocrine hormones lead to immune dysregulation, which ultimately results in autoimmune disease, by altering or amplifying cytokine production. The treatment of autoimmune disease should thus include stress management and behavioral intervention to prevent stress-related immune imbalance. Different stress reactions should be discussed with autoimmune patients, and obligatory questionnaires about trigger factors should include psychological stress in addition to infection, trauma, and other common triggers. © 2007.},

Increased sweating (52.9\% vs. 31.6\%, p = 0.006), breathlessness (50.7\% vs. 30.6\%, p = 0.006), blurred vision (34.3\% vs. 17.8\%, p = 0.016) and undue tiredness (68.7\% vs. 51.5\%, p = 0.03) were found in controls compared to cases. These findings were similar to those in Australian abbatoir workers occupationally exposed to Q fever. CDC criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome were fulfilled by 42.3\% of cases and 26\% of controls. Using visual analogue scores, symptoms were more severe in cases than in controls. Our findings support the existence of a chronic fatigue state following acute Q fever, in a group of patients exposed just once to the organism, and in circumstances free of such confounding factors as lawsuits over compensation.},

DESIGN: Population-based, retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: A coastal region endemic for Lyme disease.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a history of Lyme disease who were previously treated with antibiotics were compared with randomly selected controls.
MEASUREMENTS: A standardized physical examination, health status measure (Short Form 36), psychometric test battery, and serologic analysis.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group (n = 43), the Lyme group (n = 38; mean duration from disease onset to study evaluation, 6.2 years) had more arthralgias (61\% compared with 16\%; P {\textless} 0.0001); distal paresthesias (16\% compared with 2\%; P = 0.03); concentration difficulties (16\% compared with 2\%; P = 0.03); and fatigue (26\% compared with 9\%; P = 0.04), and they had poorer global health status scores (P = 0.04). The Lyme group also had more abnormal joints (P = 0.02) and more verbal memory deficits (P = 0.01) than did the control group. Overall, 13 patients (34\%; 95\% CI, 19\% to 49\%) had long-term sequelae from Lyme disease (arthritis or recurrent arthralgias [n = 6], neurocognitive impairment [n = 4], and neuropathy or myelopathy [n = 3]). Compared with controls, patients who had long-term sequelae had higher IgG antibody titers to the spirochete (P = 0.03) and received treatment later (34.5 months compared with 2.7 months; P {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with a history of Lyme disease have more musculoskeletal impairment and a higher prevalence of verbal memory impairment when compared with those without a history of Lyme disease. Our findings suggest that disseminated Lyme disease may be associated with long-term morbidity.},

DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal clinical review.
SETTING: North Queensland local government areas of Cairns, Douglas, Mareeba and Atherton during January to May 1998.
PARTICIPANTS: General practice patients diagnosed with RRV disease on the basis of symptoms and a positive RRV IgM result.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rheumatic symptoms and signs assessed as soon as possible after disease onset and on two subsequent occasions (up to 6.5 months after onset).
RESULTS: 57 patients were recruited, 47 of whom were reviewed three times (at means of 1.1, 2.4 and 3.6 months after disease onset). Results are reported for these 47: 46 (98\%) complained of joint pain at first review, with the ankles, wrists, fingers, knees and metacarpophalangeal joints (II-IV) most commonly involved. Prevalence of joint pain decreased progressively on second and third reviews, both overall (92\% and 68\% of patients, respectively), and in the five joints most commonly affected. The prevalence of other common rheumatic symptoms and signs, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also progressively declined over the three reviews.
CONCLUSIONS: Earlier studies may have overestimated the prevalence and duration of symptoms in RRV disease. Progressive resolution over 3-6 months appears usual.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a trigger of chronic fatigue and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). This study investigated baseline predictors of chronic fatigue six months after an acute EBV infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 200 adolescents (12-20 years old) with acute EBV infection were assessed for 149 possible baseline predictors and followed prospectively. We performed linear regression to assess possible associations between baseline predictors and fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire total score) six months after the acute EBV infection. A total of 70 healthy controls were included for cross-sectional reference. This study is part of the CEBA-project (Chronic fatigue following acute Epstein-Barr virus infection in adolescents).
RESULTS: In the final multiple linear regression model, fatigue six months after acute EBV infection was significantly and independently predicted by the following baseline variables (regression coefficient B[95\% CI]): Sensory sensitivity (0.8[0.09-1.6]), pain severity (0.2[0.02-0.3]), functional impairment (1000 steps/day) (-0.3[-0.5 to -0.08]), negative emotions (anxiety) (0.4[0.2-0.6]), verbal memory (correct word recognition) (1.7[0.1-3.3]), plasma C-reactive protein (2.8[1.1-4.4] for CRP values {\textgreater}0.86) and plasma Vitamin B12 (-0.005[-0.01 to -0.001]).
CONCLUSIONS: Development of fatigue after acute EBV infection is to a larger extent predicted by baseline variables related to symptoms and functions than to baseline variables reflecting infectious and immune processes.

The persistence of these viral genomes in all malignant cells, yet with the expression of limited latent genes, is consistent with the notion that EBV latent genes are important for malignant cell growth. While the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) and latent membrane protein-2A (LMP-2A) are critical, the EBNA-leader proteins, EBNA-2, EBNA-3A, EBNA-3C and LMP-1, are individually essential for in vitro transformation of primary B cells to lymphoblastoid cell lines. EBV-encoded RNAs and EBNA-3Bs are dispensable. In this review, the roles of EBV latent genes are summarized.},

We performed an extensive phenotypic and functional characterization of NK cells on 41 patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), or 'chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection' syndrome, and on 23 age- and sex-matched asymptomatic control subjects in an attempt to further characterize this illness. This studies demonstrated that a majority of patients with CSF have low numbers of NKH1+T3- lymphocytes, a population that represents the great majority of NK cells in normal individuals. CFS patients had normal numbers of NKH1+T3+ lymphocytes, a population that represents a relatively small fraction of NK cells in normal individuals. When tested for cytotoxicity again a variety of different target cells, patients with CFS consistently demonstrated low levels of killing. After activation of cytolytic activity with recombinant interleukin 2, patients were able to display increased killing against K562 but most patients remained unable to lyse Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cell targets. Additional cytotoxicity experiments were carried out utilizing anti-T3 monoclonal antibody to block killing by NKH1+T3+ cells. These experiments indicated that the NK cell that appears to be responsible for much of the functional activity remaining in patients with CFS belongs to the NKH1+T3+ subset, which under normal circumstances represents only approximately 20\% of the NK cell population.},

However, overactivation or dysfunction of NK cells may be associated with pathogenesis of some diseases. NK cells are found to act as a two edged weapon and play opposite roles with both regulatory and inducer activity in autoimmune diseases. Though the precise mechanisms for the opposite effects of NK cells has not been fully elucidated, the importance of NK cells in autoimmune diseases might be associated with different NK cell subsets, different tissue microenvironment and different stages of corresponding diseases. The local tissue microenvironment, unique cellular interactions and different stages of corresponding diseases shape the properties and function of NK cells. In this review, we focus on recent research on the features and function of different NK cell subsets, particularly tissue-resident NK cells in different tissues, and their potential role in autoimmune diseases.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2377-11-62},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) came to attention in the 1980s, but initial investigations did not find organic causes. Now decades later, the etiology of CFS has yet to be understood, and the role of genetic predisposition in CFS remains controversial. Recent reports of CFS association with the retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemic virus-related virus (XMRV) or other murine leukemia related retroviruses (MLV) might also suggest underlying genetic implications within the host immune system.
METHODS: We present analyses of familial clustering of CFS in a computerized genealogical resource linking multiple generations of genealogy data with medical diagnosis data of a large Utah health care system. We compare pair-wise relatedness among cases to expected relatedness in the Utah population, and we estimate risk for CFS for first, second, and third degree relatives of CFS cases.
RESULTS: We observed significant excess relatedness of CFS cases compared to that expected in this population. Significant excess relatedness was observed for both close (p {\textless}0.001) and distant relationships (p = 0.010). We also observed significant excess CFS relative risk among first (2.70, 95\% CI: 1.56-4.66), second (2.34, 95\% CI: 1.31-4.19), and third degree relatives (1.93, 95\% CI: 1.21-3.07).
CONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide strong support for a heritable contribution to predisposition to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. A population of high-risk CFS pedigrees has been identified, the study of which may provide additional understanding.},

The authors obtained telephone interview data on current chronic fatigue from 31406 individuals twins in the Swedish Twin Registry (aged 42–64 years, 75·68\% response rate), from both members of 12407 pairs and from one member of 6592 pairs. Of the complete pairs, 3269 pairs were monozygotic, 9010 pairs dizygotic, and 128 pairs of unknown zygosity. Structural equation twin modeling was used to estimate the latent genetic architecture of varying definitions of fatiguing illness.Results. Estimates of additive genetic effects, shared environmental effects, and individual-specific environmental effects were similar in males and females. No definition of current fatiguing illness (ranging from any fatigue to CFS-like illness) was strikingly distinctive. Individual-specific effects were the predominant source of variation, followed by modest genetic influences. We could not exclude a small but conceptually important contribution of shared environmental effects.Conclusions. Current fatiguing illness appears to be a complex trait resulting from both environmental and genetic sources of variation without pronounced differences by gender.},

While the aetiology is unknown, findings from recent twin surveys suggest that genetic factors may be relevant to prolonged fatigue states ({\textgreater} 1 month). To date, however, there has been no exploration of the role of familial/genetic factors in operationally defined CFS. The aims of the present study were: (i) to examine whether CFS is familial by comparing the rates of CFS in the first-degree relatives of CFS cases and medical control subjects; and (ii) to determine whether the high rate of comorbid depression in CFS is reflected in a greater familial loading for affective disorder. Twenty-five CFS cases and 36 medical control subjects were assessed for fatigue symptoms based on the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for CFS, and for lifetime psychiatric symptoms using the Schedule for Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders-Lifetime Version. Informant family history was obtained regarding first-degree relatives using the CDC criteria and the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria. In addition, informant history was supplemented by sending a questionnaire to first-degree relatives. There were significantly higher rates of CFS in the relatives of CFS cases compared with the relatives of control subjects. The rate of depression in the CFS cases was similar to previous studies but did not appear to reflect a greater familial loading for depression when compared with control subjects. However, these analyses were complicated by higher than expected rates of depression in the control group. These findings suggest that familial factors are important in the aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome.},

Cytotoxic lymphocytes combat intracellular infections. Their function is attenuated by stress. Despite numerous studies, the role of cytotoxic lymphocytes in ME/CFS remains unclear. Prompted by advances in the understanding of defects in lymphocyte cytotoxicity, the discovery of adaptive natural killer (NK) cell subsets associated with certain viral infections, and compelling links between stress, adrenaline, and cytotoxic lymphocyte function, we reassessed the role of cytotoxic lymphocytes in ME/CFS. Forty-eight patients from two independent cohorts fulfilling the Canada 2003 criteria for ME/CFS were evaluated with respect to cytotoxic lymphocyte phenotype and function. Results were compared to values from matched healthy controls. Reproducible differences between patients and controls were not found in cytotoxic lymphocyte numbers, cytotoxic granule content, activation status, exocytotic capacity, target cell killing, or cytokine production. One patient expressed low levels of perforin, explained by homozygosity for the PRF1 p.A91V variant. However, overall, this variant was present in a heterozygous state at the expected population frequency among ME/CFS patients. No single patient displayed any pathological patterns of cellular responses. Increased expansions of adaptive NK cells or deviant cytotoxic lymphocyte adrenaline-mediated inhibition were not observed. In addition, supervised dimensionality reduction analyses of the full, multidimensional datasets did not reveal any reproducible patient/control discriminators. In summary, employing sensitive assays and analyses for quantification of cytotoxic lymphocyte differentiation and function, cytotoxicity lymphocyte aberrances were not found among ME/CFS patients. These assessments of cytotoxic lymphocytes therefore do not provide useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of ME/CFS.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate the feasibility of conducting clinics for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in schools. Design School-based clinical project. Participants Children aged 11-16 years were enrolled in three state secondary schools in England. Main outcome measures Number of children newly diagnosed as having CFS/ME. Methods Attendance officers identified children missing ≥20\% of school in a 6-week term without a known cause, excluding those with a single episode off school, a known medical illness explaining the absence or known to be truanting. Children with fatigue were referred to a specialist CFS/ME service for further assessment. The authors compared children with CFS/ME identified through school-based clinics with those referred via health services. Outcomes of CFS/ME were evaluated at 6 weeks and 6 months. Results 461 of the 2855 enrolled children had missed ≥20\% school over a 6-week period. In 315, of whom three had CFS/ME, the reason for absence was known. 112 of the 146 children with unexplained absence attended clinical review at school; two had been previously diagnosed as having CFS/ME and 42 were referred on to a specialist clinic, where 23 were newly diagnosed as having CFS/ME. Therefore, 28 of the 2855 (1.0\%) children had CFS/ME. Children with CFS/ME identified through surveillance had been ill for an amount of time comparable to those referred via health services but had less fatigue (mean difference 4.4, 95\% CI 2.2 to 6.6), less disability (mean difference -5.7, 95\% CI -7.9 to -3.5) and fewer symptoms (mean difference 1.86, 95\% CI 0.8 to 2.93). Of 19 children followed up, six had fully recovered at 6 weeks and a further six at 6 months. Conclusions Chronic fatigue is an important cause of unexplained absence from school. Children diagnosed through school-based clinics are less severely affected than those referred to specialist services and appear to make rapid progress when they access treatment.},

We aimed to explore epidemiological and clinical prognostic factors of ME/CFS using operationalized criteria for recovery/improvement. Adult ME/CFS patients who attended the Internal Medicine Department of Angers University Hospital, Angers, France between October 2011 and December 2019, and were followed up until December 2020, were included retrospectively. Their medical records were reviewed for data collection. Patients were classified into two groups according to the presence or absence of recovery/improvement (R/I) and compared for epidemiological characteristics, fatigue features, post-exertional malaise severity, clinical manifestations, and comorbidities. The subgroups of recovered and significantly improved patients were then compared. 168 patients were included. Recovery and improvement rates were 8.3\% and 4.8\%, respectively. Older age at disease onset was associated with R/I (OR 1.06 [95\% CI 1.007–1.110] (p = 0.028)), while diagnostic delay was inversely associated with R/I (OR 0.98 [95\% CI 0.964–0.996] (p = 0.036)). The study findings confirmed the poor prognosis of ME/CFS and the deleterious effect of diagnostic delay on disease progression. Interestingly, being older at disease onset was associated with better outcomes, which offers hope to patients for recovery/improvement even at an advanced age.},

	abstract = {Alterations in the innate immune response may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). However, studies have been limited by small sample sizes, use of patients from tertiary care settings, inappropriate selection of controls, and failure to control for confounding demographic, medical and behavioral factors independently associated with immune activity. It is also not known whether specific symptoms account for observed associations between CFS and the innate immune response. To address these limitations, the current study examined plasma concentrations of high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), white blood cell count (WBC) and a combined inflammation factor in a large population-based sample. Log-transformed mean plasma concentrations of hs-CRP were increased in subjects with CFS (n=102) and in subjects with unwellness symptoms that did not meet diagnostic criteria for CFS (defined as "insufficient fatigue" [ISF]) (n=240) when compared to subjects who were well (n=115). Log transformed WBC was increased in ISF and was increased at a trend level in CFS. The combined inflammation factor was increased in both CFS and ISF. Subjects with CFS and ISF did not differ on any of the inflammation measures. In the entire subject population, the physical component summary score (PCS), but not the mental component summary score (MCS), from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) was negatively associated with each of the inflammation measures. Depressive symptoms were also associated with increased log hs-CRP. After adjustment for age, sex, race, location of residence, BMI, depressive status and immune-modulating medications, subjects classified as ISF continued to demonstrate increased log hs-CRP, WBC and elevations on the inflammation factor when compared to well controls; however, associations between CFS and log hs-CRP and the inflammation factor were no longer statistically significant. After adjustment, PCS score also remained independently associated with each of the inflammation measures. These findings support a role for innate immune activation in unexplained fatigue and unwellness, but do not suggest that immune activation is specific to CFS.},

Cases had to meet established criteria for CFS and be compared with healthy controls. Papers retrieved were assessed for both inclusionary criteria and quality. 38 papers met the inclusionary criteria. The quality of the studies varied. 77 serum or plasma cytokines were measured without immune stimulation. Cases of CFS had significantly elevated concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in five out of eight (63\%) studies. No other cytokines were present in abnormal concentrations in the majority of studies, although insufficient data were available for some cytokines. Following physical exercise there were no differences in circulating cytokine levels between cases and controls and exercise made no difference to already elevated TGF-β concentrations. The finding of elevated TGF-β concentration, at biologically relevant levels, needs further exploration, but circulating cytokines do not seem to explain the core characteristic of post-exertional fatigue.},

There are no validated laboratory tests for diagnosis or management despite global efforts to find biomarkers of disease. We considered the possibility that inability to identify such biomarkers reflected variations in diagnostic criteria and laboratory methods as well as the timing of sample collection during the course of the illness. Accordingly, we leveraged two large, multicenter cohort studies of ME/CFS to assess the relationship of immune signatures with diagnosis, illness duration, and other clinical variables. Controls were frequency-matched on key variables known to affect immune status, including season of sampling and geographic site, in addition to age and sex. We report here distinct alterations in plasma immune signatures early in the course of ME/CFS (n = 52) relative to healthy controls (n = 348) that are not present in subjects with longer duration of illness (n = 246). Analyses based on disease duration revealed that early ME/CFS cases had a prominent activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as dissociation of intercytokine regulatory networks. We found a stronger correlation of cytokine alterations with illness duration than with measures of illness severity, suggesting that the immunopathology of ME/CFS is not static. These findings have critical implications for discovery of interventional strategies and early diagnosis of ME/CFS.},

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of biotherapies vs placebo on fatigue, in combination with DMARDs. Fatigue was measured using the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue (FACIT-F) or short-form 36 (SF-36) vitality scores at baseline and at Week 24.

The overall ESs of all biotherapies vs placebo on fatigue were small (ES = 0.45; 95\% CI 0.31, 0.58) as well as for anti-TNFs (ES = 0.36; 95\% CI 0.21, 0.51). The ESs were small in IR-DMARD RA (ES = 0.38; 95\% CI 0.30, 0.46), similar between anti-TNF and non-anti-TNF agents and moderate in IR-anti-TNF RA (ES = 0.57; 95\% CI 0.27, 0.86).Conclusion.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is unknown, but genetic influences may be important in its expression. Our objective was to assess the role of genetic and environmental factors in unexplained chronic fatigue.
METHODS: A classic twin study was conducted using 146 female-female twin pairs, of whom at least one member reported {\textgreater} or =6 months of fatigue. After completing questionnaires on symptoms, zygosity, physical health, and a psychiatric interview, twins were classified using three increasingly stringent definitions: 1) chronic fatigue for {\textgreater} or =6 months, 2) chronic fatigue not explained by exclusionary medical conditions, and 3) idiopathic chronic fatigue not explained by medical or psychiatric exclusionary criteria of the chronic fatigue syndrome case definition. Concordance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic twins were calculated for each fatigue definition along with estimates of the relative magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on chronic fatigue.
RESULTS: The concordance rate was higher in monozygotic than dizygotic twins for each definition of chronic fatigue. For idiopathic chronic fatigue, the concordance rates were 55\% in monozygotic and 19\% in dizygotic twins (p =.042). The estimated heritability in liability was 19\% (95\% confidence interval = 0-56) for chronic fatigue {\textgreater} or =6 months, 30\% (95\% confidence interval = 0-81) for chronic fatigue not explained by medical conditions, and 51\% (95\% confidence interval = 7-96) for idiopathic chronic fatigue.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence supporting the familial aggregation of fatigue and suggest that genes may play a role in the etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome.},

However, before such studies are undertaken, it is important to know what proportion of human genetic variation they are likely to survey and what the likely costs will be per true-positive result.The allelic spectrum of complex diseases — that is, the range of the frequencies and effect sizes of susceptibility loci —will influence the success of genome-wide association studies. Large sample sizes will be required to search even the most accessible end of this spectrum: that is, alleles with population allele frequencies exceeding 0.1 and with odds ratios of 1.3 and above.The existence of extensive regions of linkage disequilibrium in the human genome will greatly reduce the cost of genotyping in genome-wide association studies, as this allows the use of tag SNPs that provide information on a number of other SNPs that are not directly genotyped.However, as much as 30\% of the common variants in the genome remains unknown and the latest high-throughput technologies convert only about 50\% of SNPs into robust assays. In addition, extensive resequencing and genotyping will have to be carried out to ensure that SNPs in regions of low linkage disequilibrium are surveyed comprehensively.Other factors that need to be taken into account in the design and execution of initial genome-wide association studies, to avoid loss of statistical power, include possible selection bias, population substructure and misclassification errors.},

Susceptibility to fatigue may be influenced by genetic factors including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), especially in the regulatory regions, of relevant genes. To further investigate the association of SNPs with fatigue in various patient populations, a systematic search was conducted on Pubmed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts Database for fatigue related-terms in combination with polymorphisms or genetic variation-related terms. Fifty papers in total met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this analysis. These 50 papers were further classified into three subgroups for evaluation: chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and other disease-related fatigue. SNPs in regulatory pathways of immune and neurotransmitter systems were found to play important roles in the etiologies of CFS, CRF and other disease-related fatigue. Evidence for associations between elevated fatigue and specific polymorphisms in TNFα, IL1b, IL4 and IL6 genes was revealed for all three subgroups of fatigue. We also found CFS shared a series of polymorphisms in HLA, IFN-γ, 5-HT and NR3C1 genes with other disease-related fatigue, however these SNPs (excluding IFN-γ) were not found to be adequately investigated in CRF. Gaps in knowledge related to fatigue etiology and recommendations for future research are further discussed.},

We used ‘omic” assays and serology to deeply characterize the global and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in the blood of individuals with clear LC and non-LC clinical trajectories, 8 months postinfection. We found that LC individuals exhibited systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This was evidenced by global differences in T cell subset distribution implying ongoing immune responses, as well as by sex-specific perturbations in cytolytic subsets. LC individuals displayed increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells poised to migrate to inflamed tissues and exhausted SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and a mis-coordination between their SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cell responses. Our analysis suggested an improper crosstalk between the cellular and humoral adaptive immunity in LC, which can lead to immune dysregulation, inflammation and clinical symptoms associated with this debilitating condition.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Intense scientific effort to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in daunting numbers of genomic sequences. We witnessed evolutionary events that could mostly be inferred indirectly before, such as the emergence of variants with distinct phenotypes, for example transmissibility, severity and immune evasion. This Review explores the mechanisms that generate genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2, underlying the within-host and population-level processes that underpin these events. We examine the selective forces that likely drove the evolution of higher transmissibility and, in some cases, higher severity during the first year of the pandemic and the role of antigenic evolution during the second and third years, together with the implications of immune escape and reinfections, and the increasing evidence for and potential relevance of recombination. In order to understand how major lineages, such as variants of concern (VOCs), are generated, we contrast the evidence for the chronic infection model underlying the emergence of VOCs with the possibility of an animal reservoir playing a role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and conclude that the former is more likely. We evaluate uncertainties and outline scenarios for the possible future evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2.},

The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes.

The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies. They further enable the design of escape-resistant antibody cocktails—including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same RBD surface but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.},

	abstract = {Background
Trial findings show cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) can be effective treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome, but patients' organisations have reported that these treatments can be harmful and favour pacing and specialist health care. We aimed to assess effectiveness and safety of all four treatments.
Methods
In our parallel-group randomised trial, patients meeting Oxford criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome were recruited from six secondary-care clinics in the UK and randomly allocated by computer-generated sequence to receive specialist medical care (SMC) alone or with adaptive pacing therapy (APT), CBT, or GET. Primary outcomes were fatigue (measured by Chalder fatigue questionnaire score) and physical function (measured by short form-36 subscale score) up to 52 weeks after randomisation, and safety was assessed primarily by recording all serious adverse events, including serious adverse reactions to trial treatments. Primary outcomes were rated by participants, who were necessarily unmasked to treatment assignment; the statistician was masked to treatment assignment for the analysis of primary outcomes. We used longitudinal regression models to compare SMC alone with other treatments, APT with CBT, and APT with GET. The final analysis included all participants for whom we had data for primary outcomes. This trial is registered at http://isrctn.org, number ISRCTN54285094.
Findings
We recruited 641 eligible patients, of whom 160 were assigned to the APT group, 161 to the CBT group, 160 to the GET group, and 160 to the SMC-alone group. Compared with SMC alone, mean fatigue scores at 52 weeks were 3·4 (95\% CI 1·8 to 5·0) points lower for CBT (p=0·0001) and 3·2 (1·7 to 4·8) points lower for GET (p=0·0003), but did not differ for APT (0·7 [−0·9 to 2·3] points lower; p=0·38). Compared with SMC alone, mean physical function scores were 7·1 (2·0 to 12·1) points higher for CBT (p=0·0068) and 9·4 (4·4 to 14·4) points higher for GET (p=0·0005), but did not differ for APT (3·4 [−1·6 to 8·4] points lower; p=0·18). Compared with APT, CBT and GET were associated with less fatigue (CBT p=0·0027; GET p=0·0059) and better physical function (CBT p=0·0002; GET p{\textless}0·0001). Subgroup analysis of 427 participants meeting international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome and 329 participants meeting London criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis yielded equivalent results. Serious adverse reactions were recorded in two (1\%) of 159 participants in the APT group, three (2\%) of 161 in the CBT group, two (1\%) of 160 in the GET group, and two (1\%) of 160 in the SMC-alone group.
Interpretation
CBT and GET can safely be added to SMC to moderately improve outcomes for chronic fatigue syndrome, but APT is not an effective addition.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) is characterized by neuro-psychiatric (e.g. depression, irritability, sleep disorders, autonomic symptoms and neurocognitive defects) and physio-somatic (fatigue, a flu-like malaise, hyperalgesia, irritable bowel, muscle pain and tension) symptoms. New ME/CFS case definitions based on consensus criteria among experts are largely inadequate, e.g. those of the US Institute of Medicine .
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to delineate a new case definition of ME/CFS based on pattern recognition methods and using neuro-immune, inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (neuro-IO\&NS) biomarkers as external validating criteria.
METHODS: We measured the 12-item Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating (FF) Scale in 196 subjects with CFS (CDC criteria) and 83 with chronic fatigue. The "Neuro-IO\&NS" biomarkers were: IgM / IgA responses against LPS of gut commensal bacteria (leaky gut), IgM responses to O\&NS modified neoepitopes, autoimmunity to serotonin, plasma interleukin-1 (IL-1) and serum neopterin.
RESULTS: Cluster analysis showed the presence of two well-separated clusters with highly significant differences in symptoms and biomarkers. The cluster with higher scores on all FF items was externally validated against all IO\&NS biomarkers and therefore this diagnostic group was labeled "Neuro-IO\&NS Fatigue" or "Neuro-Inflammatory and Oxidative Fatigue" (NIOF). An algorithm was constructed which defined NIOF as chronic fatigue and 4 or more of the following 6 symptoms: muscle tension, memory disturbances, sleep disorders, irritable bowel, headache or a flu-like malaise. There was a significant overlap between NIOF and CFS although NIOF criteria were much more restrictive. Factor analysis showed two factors, the first a fatigue-hyperalgesia (fibromyalgic complaints) and the second a fatigue-depression factor.},

Given the disabling nature of chronic fatigue it may have a substantial impact on service use and costs as well as on employment. This study estimates this impact.Method. Patients presenting to general practitioners with unexplained chronic fatigue were recruited to the study. Service use over a 3 month period was measured and lost employment recorded. These data were used to estimate economic costs. Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were compared to patients with only chronic fatigue using a multiple regression model with sample differences controlled.Results. The mean total cost of services and lost employment across the sample was £1906 for the 3-month period with formal services accounting for 9·3\% of this figure. Service use was higher for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome compared to those with chronic fatigue alone. Total 3-month costs were on average higher for chronic fatigue syndrome (£3515 v. £1176) but when sample differences were taken account of the mean difference was reduced to £1406 (P=0·086). Over 90\% of the cost was accounted for by care provided by friends and family members and by lost employment. Patients with dependants had significantly higher costs than those with none and costs were also significantly higher for greater levels of functional impairment.Conclusion. Chronic fatigue imposes substantial economic costs on society, mainly in the form of informal care and lost employment. Treatments need to be developed which recognize these impacts.},

Knowledge of the clinical features was also assessed.Results. 811 GPs (77\%) returned the questionnaire. 48\% of GPs did not feel confident with making a diagnosis of CFS/ME and 41\% did not feel confident in treatment. 72\% of GPs accepted CFS/ME as a recognisable clinical entity and those GPs had significantly more positive attitudes. Three other key factors that were significantly, positively associated with GPs' attitudes were knowing someone socially with CFS/ME, being male and seeing more patients with the condition in the last year.Conclusion. Despite the publication of guidance for GPs on CFS/ME, confidence with making a diagnosis and management was found to be low. Educational initiatives and guidance for GPs should stress the importance of accepting CFS/ME as a recognisable clinical entity, as this is linked to having a positive attitude and could lead to improved confidence to make a diagnosis and treat CFS/ME patients.},

	abstract = {Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) are debilitating diseases with overlapping symptomology and there are currently no validated tests for definitive diagnosis of either syndrome. While there is evidence supporting the premise that some herpesviruses may act as possible triggers of ME/CFS, the involvement of herpesviruses in the pathophysiology of GWI has not been studied in spite of a higher prevalence of ME/CFS in these patients. We have previously demonstrated that the deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolases (dUTPase) encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) possess novel functions in innate and adaptive immunity. The results of this study demonstrate that a significant percentage of patients with ME/CFS (30.91-52.7\%) and GWI (29.34\%) are simultaneously producing antibodies against multiple human herpesviruses-encoded dUTPases and/or the human dUTPase when compared to controls (17.21\%). GWI patients exhibited significantly higher levels of antibodies to the HHV-6 and human dUTPases than controls (P = 0.0053 and P = 0.0036, respectively), while the ME/CFS cohort had higher anti-EBV-dUTPase antibodies than in both GWI patients (P = 0.0008) and controls (P {\textless} 0.0001) as well as significantly higher anti-human dUTPase antibodies than in controls (P = 0.0241). These results suggest that screening of patients’ sera for the presence of various combinations of anti-dUTPase antibodies could be used as potential biomarkers to help identify/distinguish patients with these syndromes and better direct treatment.},

We report the lasting symptom burden of COVID-19 patients from the first wave of the pandemic.

We assessed symptom burden at follow-up using a standardised data collection technique during virtual outpatient clinic appointments. Eighty-six percent of patients reported at least one residual symptom at follow-up. No patients had persistent radiographic abnormalities. The presence of symptoms at follow-up was not associated with the severity of the acute COVID-19 illness. Females were significantly more likely to report residual symptoms including anxiety (p = 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.004), and myalgia (p = 0.022). The presence of long-lasting symptoms is common in COVID-19 patients. We suggest that the phenomenon of Long-COVID may not be directly attributable to the effect of SARS-CoV-2, and believe the biopsychosocial effects of COVID-19 may play a greater role in its aetiology.},

A subset of 16 CFS patients demonstrated HCMV IgG, but no HCMV IgM serum antibodies to conformational structural HCMV antigens (designated, V). By convention, these findings are interpreted to indicate only a remote HCMV infection. However, HCMV IgM p52 and CM2 antibodies were uniquely present in these 16 CFS patients. Other CFS patients with similar HCMV (V) IgG antibodies (18 patients), non-fatigued HCMV (V) IgG-positive control patients (18 patients), random HCMV (V) IgG-positive control patients from a clinical laboratory (26 patients), and non-fatigued HCMV (V) IgG-negative control patients (15 patients) did not have HCMV, IgM p52 or CM2 serum antibodies (p {\textless} 0.05). Control HCMV (V) IgG-positive patients had no serum IgM HCMV (V) antibodies to conventional structural HCMV (V) antigen. Thus, 77 various control patients did not contain IgM p52 or CM2 serum antibodies. The presence of IgM p52 and/or CM2 HCMV serum antibodies in this subset of CSF-specific patients may detect incomplete HCMV multiplication in which a part of the HCMV protein-coding content of the HCMV genome is processed, but remains unassembled. These findings suggest that the presence of HCMV IgM p52 and CM2 serum antibodies may be a specific diagnostic test for the diagnosis of a subset of CFS patients. Further, these data suggest an etiologic relationship for HCMV infection in this group of CFS patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Subtle alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been proposed as a shared pathway linking numerous etiological and perpetuating processes with symptoms and observed physiological abnormalities. Because the HPA axis is involved in the adaptive responses to stress and CFS patients experience a worsening of symptoms after physical and psychological stress, we tested HPA axis functioning with three centrally acting stress tests.
METHODS: We used two procedures mimicking real-life stressors and compared them with a standardized pharmacological neuroendocrine challenge test. CFS patients were compared with healthy control subjects regarding their cardiovascular and endocrine reactivity in a psychosocial stress test and a standardized exercise test, and their endocrine response in the insulin tolerance test (ITT).
RESULTS: Controlling for possible confounding variables, we found significantly lower ACTH response levels in the psychosocial stress test and the exercise test, and significantly lower ACTH responses in the ITT, with no differences in plasma total cortisol responses. Also, salivary-free cortisol responses did not differ between the groups in the psychosocial stress test and the exercise test but were significantly higher for the CFS patients in the ITT. In all tests CFS patients had significantly reduced baseline ACTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CFS patients are capable of mounting a sufficient cortisol response under different types of stress but that on a central level subtle dysregulations of the HPA axis exist.},

	abstract = {Background: Much debate is transpiring regarding whether chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) are different illnesses. Several prior studies that compared the Fukuda et al. CFS criteria to the Canadian ME/CFS criteria found that the Canadian criteria identified patients with more functional impairments and greater physical, mental, and cognitive problems than those who met Fukuda et al. criteria. These samples were located in the Chicago metropolitan area, so the results could not be generalized to other locations. In addition, past studies used a symptom questionnaire that was not specifically developed to tap the Canadian criteria. Purpose: The present comparative study of CFS and ME/CFS criteria was intended to correct the limitations of prior studies. Methods: This article used data from three distinct samples to compare patients who met criteria for the ME/CFS Canadian clinical case definition to those who met the Fukuda et al. CFS case definition. Results: Findings indicated that fewer individuals met the Canadian criteria than the Fukuda et al. criteria. Those who met the Canadian criteria evidenced more severe symptoms and physical functioning impairment. Conclusions: Future research should continue to compare existing case definitions and determine which criteria best select for this illness.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the role of the autonomic nervous system in the symptoms of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and delineate the pathogenesis of the orthostatic Intolerance and predisposition to neurally mediated syncope reported in this patient group.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three CFS patients and controls performed a battery of autonomic function tests. The CFS patients completed questionnaires pertaining to autonomic and CFS symptoms, their level of physical activity, and premorbid and coexisting psychiatric disorders. The relationship between autonomic test results, cardiovascular deconditioning, and psychiatric disorders was examined with multivariate statistics and the evidence that autonomic changes seen in CFS might be secondary to a postviral, idiopathic autonomic neuropathy was explored.
RESULTS: The CFS subjects had a significant increase in baseline (P {\textless} 0.01) and maximum heart rate (HR) on standing and tilting (both P {\textless} 0.0001). Tests of parasympathetic nervous system function (the expiratory inspiratory ratio, P {\textless} 0.005; maximum minus minimum HR difference, P {\textless} 0.05), were significantly less in the CFS group as were measures of sympathetic nervous system function (systolic blood pressure decrease with tilting, P {\textless} 0.01; diastolic blood pressure decrease with tilting, P {\textless} 0.05; and the systolic blood pressure decrease during phase II of a Valsalva maneuver, P {\textless} 0.05). Twenty-five percent of CFS subjects had a positive tilt table test. The physical activity index was a significant predictor of autonomic test results (resting, sitting, standing, and tilted HR, P {\textless} 0.05 to P {\textless} 0.009); and the blood pressure decrease in phase II of the Valvalsa maneuver, P {\textless} 0.05) whereas premorbid and coexistent psychiatric conditions were not. The onset of autonomic symptoms occurred within 4 weeks of a viral infection in 46\% of patients-a temporal pattern that is consistent with a postviral, idiopathic autonomic neuropathy.
CONCLUSION: Patients with CFS show alterations in measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system function. These results, which provide the physiological basis for the orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms of autonomic function in this patient group, may be explained by cardiovascular deconditioning, a postviral idiopathic autonomic neuropathy, or both.},

This includes an impaired function of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), possibly driven by serum factor(s), which leads to inadequate adenosine triphosphate generation and excessive lactate accumulation. A reminiscent energy blockade is likely to occur in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), caused by anti-PDC autoantibodies, as recently proposed. PBC is associated with fatigue and post-exertional malaise, also signifying ME/CFS. We herein have investigated whether ME/CFS patients have autoreactive antibodies that could interfere with mitochondrial function. We found that only 1 of 161 examined ME/CFS patients was positive for anti-PDC, while all PBC patients (15/15) presented significant IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-PDC reactivity, as previously shown. None of fibromyalgia patients (0/14), multiple sclerosis patients (0/29), and healthy blood donors (0/44) controls showed reactivities. Anti-mitochondrial autoantibodies (inner and outer membrane) were negative in ME/CFS cohort. Anti-cardiolipin antibody levels in patients did not differ significantly from healthy blood donors. In conclusion, the impaired mitochondrial/metabolic dysfunction, observed in ME/CFS, cannot be explained by presence of circulating autoantibodies against the tested mitochondrial epitopes.},

REFS highly outperformed other methods, with an AUC of 0.92. We validated the results on a different platform (AUC of 0.95) and in DNA methylation data obtained from four public studies on ME/CFS (99 patients and 50 controls), identifying 48 gene-associated CpGs that predicted disease status as well (AUC of 0.97).

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a widespread neurodegenerative autoimmune disease with unknown etiology. It is increasingly evident that, together with pathogenic T cells, autoreactive B cells are among the major players in MS development. The analysis of myelin neuroantigen-specific antibody repertoires and their possible cross-reactivity against environmental antigens, including viral proteins, could shed light on the mechanism of MS induction and progression. A phage display library of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) was constructed from blood lymphocytes of patienst with MS as a potential source of representative MS autoantibodies. Structural alignment of 13 clones selected toward myelin basic protein (MBP), one of the major myelin antigens, showed high homology within variable regions with cerebrospinal fluid MS-associated antibodies as well as with antibodies toward Epstein-Barr latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Three scFv clones showed pronounced specificity to MBP fragments 65–92 and 130–156, similar to the serum MS antibodies. One of these clones, designated E2, in both scFv and full-size human antibody constructs, was shown to react with both MBP and LMP1 proteins in vitro, suggesting natural cross-reactivity. Thus, antibodies induced against LMP1 during Epstein-Barr virus infection might act as inflammatory trigger by reacting with MBP, suggesting molecular mimicry in the mechanism of MS pathogenesis.—Gabibov, A.

	abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a heterogeneous condition of unknown aetiology characterized by multiple symptoms including fatigue, post-exertional malaise and cognitive impairment, lasting for at least 6 months. Recently, two clinical trials of B cell depletion therapy with rituximab (anti-CD20) reported convincing improvement in symptoms. A possible but undefined role for B cells has therefore been proposed. Studies of the relative percentages of B cell subsets in patients with ME/CFS have not revealed any reproducible differences from healthy controls (HC). In order to explore whether more subtle alterations in B cell subsets related to B cell differentiation exist in ME/CFS patients we used flow cytometry to immunophenotype CD19+ B cells. The panel utilized immunoglobulin (Ig)D, CD27 and CD38 (classical B cell subsets) together with additional markers. A total of 38 patients fulfilling Canadian, Centre for Disease Control and Fukuda ME/CFS criteria and 32 age- and sex-matched HC were included. We found no difference in percentages of classical subsets between ME/CFS patients and HC. However, we observed an increase in frequency (P \&lt; 0·01) and expression (MFI; P = 0·03) of CD24 on total B cells, confined to IgD+ subsets. Within memory subsets, a higher frequency of CD21+CD38– B cells (\&gt;20\%) was associated with the presence of ME/CFS [odds ratio: 3·47 (1·15–10·46); P = 0·03] compared with HC, and there was a negative correlation with disease duration. In conclusion, we identified possible changes in B cell phenotype in patients with ME/CFS. These may reflect altered B cell function and, if confirmed in other patient cohorts, could provide a platform for studies based on clinical course or responsiveness to rituximab therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disease of unknown aetiology. Major CFS symptom relief during cancer chemotherapy in a patient with synchronous CFS and lymphoma spurred a pilot study of B-lymphocyte depletion using the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, which demonstrated significant clinical response in three CFS patients.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study (NCT00848692), 30 CFS patients were randomised to either Rituximab 500 mg/m(2) or saline, given twice two weeks apart, with follow-up for 12 months. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) was not detected in any of the patients. The responses generally affected all CFS symptoms. Major or moderate overall response, defined as lasting improvements in self-reported Fatigue score during follow-up, was seen in 10 out of 15 patients (67\%) in the Rituximab group and in two out of 15 patients (13\%) in the Placebo group (p = 0.003). Mean response duration within the follow-up period for the 10 responders to Rituximab was 25 weeks (range 8-44). Four Rituximab patients had clinical response durations past the study period. General linear models for repeated measures of Fatigue scores during follow-up showed a significant interaction between time and intervention group (p = 0.018 for self-reported, and p = 0.024 for physician-assessed), with differences between the Rituximab and Placebo groups between 6-10 months after intervention. The primary end-point, defined as effect on self-reported Fatigue score 3 months after intervention, was negative. There were no serious adverse events. Two patients in the Rituximab group with pre-existing psoriasis experienced moderate psoriasis worsening.
CONCLUSION: The delayed responses starting from 2-7 months after Rituximab treatment, in spite of rapid B-cell depletion, suggests that CFS is an autoimmune disease and may be consistent with the gradual elimination of autoantibodies preceding clinical responses. The present findings will impact future research efforts in CFS.

The onset of CFS may follow a viral infection or period of stress. Patients with CFS do not have hypogammaglobulinaemia, predisposition to recurrent bacterial infections or symptoms of autoimmunity. To date, defects in B cell numbers or function have not been shown in the literature. However, treatment with anti-B cell therapy using Rituximab has recently shown benefit to CFS patients. We therefore postulated that patients with CFS had a subtle humoral immune dysfunction, and performed extended B cell immunophenotyping. We undertook a detailed characterization of the proportions of the different B cell subsets in 33 patients with CFS fulfilling the Canadian and Fukada criteria for CFS and compared these with 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). CFS patients had greater numbers of naive B cells as a percentage of lymphocytes: 6·3 versus 3·9\% in HC (P = 0·034), greater numbers of naive B cells as a percentage of B cells: 65 versus 47\% in controls (P = 0·003), greater numbers of transitional B cells: 1·8 versus 0·8\% in controls (P = 0·025) and reduced numbers of plasmablasts: 0·5 versus 0·9\% in controls (P = 0·013). While the cause of these changes is unclear, we speculate whether they may suggest a subtle tendency to autoimmunity.},

Previously, we found that B cells from ME/CFS patients have an increased expression of CD24, a modulator of many cellular functions including those of cell stress. The relative ability of B cells from ME/CFS patients and healthy controls (HC) to respond to rapid changes in energy demand was compared.MethodsCD24, the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, the NAD-degrading enzyme CD38, and mitochondrial mass (MM) were measured following cross-linking of the B cell receptor and costimulation with either T-cell-dependent or Toll-like-receptor-9-dependent agonists. The levels of metabolites consumed/produced were measured using 1H-NMR spectroscopy and analyzed in relation to cell growth and immunophenotype.ResultsProliferating B cells from patients with ME/CFS showed a lower mitochondrial mass and a significantly increased usage of essential amino acids compared with those from HC, with a significantly delayed loss of CD24 and an increased expression of CD38 following stimulation.DiscussionThe immunophenotype results suggested the triggering of a stress response in ME/CFS B cells associated with the increased usage of additional substrates to maintain necessary ATP levels. Disturbances in energy metabolism in ME/CFS B cells were thus confirmed in a dynamic in vitro model, providing the basis for further mechanistic investigations.},

By applying a next-generation sequencing to determine the clone-based IGHV/IGHD/IGHJ repertoires, we revealed a biased usage of several IGHV genes in peripheral blood B cells from ME/CFS patients. Results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis further indicated a possibility of distinguishing patients from healthy controls, based on the skewed B cell repertoire. Meanwhile, B cell clones using IGHV3-30 and IGHV3-30-3 genes were more frequent in patients with an obvious infection-related episode at onset, and correlated to expression levels of interferon response genes in plasmablasts. Collectively, these results imply that B cell responses in ME/CFS are directed against an infectious agents or priming antigens induced before disease onset.},

Other viruses in the same phylogenetic group have been responsible for previous regional outbreaks, including SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin, similar to the causative viruses of these previous outbreaks. The repetitive introduction of animal viruses into human populations resulting in disease outbreaks suggests that similar future epidemics are inevitable. Therefore, understanding the molecular origin and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will provide critical insights for preparing for and preventing future outbreaks. A key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is its propensity for genetic recombination across host species boundaries. Consequently, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 harbors signatures of multiple recombination events, likely encompassing multiple species and broad geographic regions. Other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome show the impact of purifying selection. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the virus to enter host cells, exhibits signatures of both purifying selection and ancestral recombination events, leading to an effective S protein capable of infecting human and many other mammalian cells. The global spread and explosive growth of the SARS-CoV-2 population (within human hosts) has contributed additional mutational variability into this genome, increasing opportunities for future recombination.},

Methods The suite of existing pandemic preparedness generic epidemiological early investigation protocols was rapidly adapted for COVID-19, branded the ‘UNITY studies’ and promoted globally for the implementation of standardized and quality studies. Ten protocols were developed investigating household (HH) transmission, the first few cases (FFX), population seroprevalence (SEROPREV), health facilities transmission (n = 2), vaccine effectiveness (n = 2), pregnancy outcomes and transmission, school transmission, and surface contamination. Implementation was supported by WHO and its partners globally, with emphasis to support building surveillance and research capacities in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Results WHO generic protocols were rapidly developed and published on the WHO website, 5/10 protocols within the first 3 months of the response. As of 30 June 2021, 172 investigations were implemented by 97 countries, of which 62 (64\%) were LMIC. The majority of countries implemented population seroprevalence (71 countries) and first few cases/household transmission (37 countries) studies. Conclusion The widespread adoption of UNITY protocols across all WHO regions indicates that they addressed subnational and national needs to support local public health decision-making to prevent and control the pandemic.},

Dromedary camels, hosts for MERS-CoV, are implicated in direct or indirect transmission to human beings, although the exact mode of transmission is unknown. The virus was first isolated from a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in June, 2012, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of May 31, 2015, 1180 laboratory-confirmed cases (483 deaths; 40\% mortality) have been reported to WHO. Both community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases have been reported with little human-to-human transmission reported in the community. Although most cases of MERS have occurred in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cases have been reported in Europe, the USA, and Asia in people who travelled from the Middle East or their contacts. Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities. No specific drug treatment exists for MERS and infection prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent spread in health-care facilities. MERS-CoV continues to be an endemic, low-level public health threat. However, the virus could mutate to have increased interhuman transmissibility, increasing its pandemic potential.},

In this review, we summarize current SARS-CoV-2 research, with an emphasis on transmission, tissue tropism, viral pathogenesis, and immune antagonism. We further present advances in animal models that are important for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development, and therapeutic testing. When necessary, comparisons are made from studies with SARS to provide further perspectives on coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as draw inferences for future investigations.},

Declaring public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC) is a cornerstone of the IHR. Here we review how PHEIC are formally declared, the diseases for which such declarations have been made from 2007 to 2020 and justifications for such declarations.Six events were declared PHEIC between 2007 and 2020: the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Ebola (West African outbreak 2013–2015, outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo 2018–2020), poliomyelitis (2014 to present), Zika (2016) and COVID-19 (2020 to present). Poliomyelitis is the longest PHEIC. Zika was the first PHEIC for an arboviral disease. For several other emerging diseases a PHEIC was not declared despite the fact that the public health impact of the event was considered serious and associated with potential for international spread.The binary nature of a PHEIC declaration is often not helpful for events where a tiered or graded approach is needed. The strength of PHEIC declarations is the ability to rapidly mobilize international coordination, streamline funding and accelerate the advancement of the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics under emergency use authorization. The ultimate purpose of such declaration is to catalyse timely evidence-based action, to limit the public health and societal impacts of emerging and re-emerging disease risks while preventing unwarranted travel and trade restrictions.},

Such unprecedented extent of mobility restriction to curb the COVID-19 pandemic may have profound impacts on how individuals live, travel and retain well-being. This systematic review aims to identify (i) the social consequences of mass quarantine—community-wide movement restrictions—during previous and current infectious disease outbreaks and (ii) recommended strategies to mitigate the negative social implications of COVID-19 lockdowns. Considering social determinants of health, we conducted a systematic review by searching five databases (Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database) for publications from inception to 9 April 2020. No limitation was set on language, location or study type. Studies that (i) contained peer-reviewed original empirical evidence and (ii) focussed on non-epidemiological implications of mass quarantine were included. We thematically synthesized and reported data due to heterogeneous disease and country context. Of 3067 publications found, 15 original peer-reviewed articles were selected for full-text extraction. Psychological distress, heightened communication inequalities, food insecurity, economic challenges, diminished access to health care, alternative delivery of education and gender-based violence were identified as negative social consequences of community-based quarantine in six infectious disease epidemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, altruistic attitudes were identified as a positive consequence during previous quarantines. Diverse psychological and social consequences of mass quarantine in previous and current epidemics were evident, but individual country policies had been highly varied in how well they addressed the needs of affected individuals, especially those who are socially marginalized. Policymakers should balance the pros and cons of movement restrictions, facilitate multisectoral action to tackle social inequalities, provide clear and coherent guidance to the public and undertake time-bound policy evaluations to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and to establish preparedness strategies for future epidemics.},

The parameters, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values, were derived from random-effects meta-analysis.The mean estimate of the incubation period and different SARS-CoV-2 strains.A total of 142 studies with 8112 patients were included. The pooled incubation period was 6.57 days (95\% CI, 6.26-6.88) and ranged from 1.80 to 18.87 days. The incubation period of COVID-19 caused by the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants were reported in 1 study (with 6374 patients), 1 study (10 patients), 6 studies (2368 patients) and 5 studies (829 patients), respectively. The mean incubation period of COVID-19 was 5.00 days (95\% CI, 4.94-5.06 days) for cases caused by the Alpha variant, 4.50 days (95\% CI, 1.83-7.17 days) for the Beta variant, 4.41 days (95\% CI, 3.76-5.05 days) for the Delta variant, and 3.42 days (95\% CI, 2.88-3.96 days) for the Omicron variant. The mean incubation was 7.43 days (95\% CI, 5.75-9.11 days) among older patients (ie, aged over 60 years old), 8.82 days (95\% CI, 8.19-9.45 days) among infected children (ages 18 years or younger), 6.99 days (95\% CI, 6.07-7.92 days) among patients with nonsevere illness, and 6.69 days (95\% CI, 4.53-8.85 days) among patients with severe illness.The findings of this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved and mutated continuously throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, producing variants with different enhanced transmission and virulence. Identifying the incubation period of different variants is a key factor in determining the isolation period.},

Although most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a mild to moderate disease with virus replication restricted mainly to the upper airways, some progress to having a life-threatening pneumonia. In this Review, we explore recent clinical and experimental advances regarding SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and discuss potential mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), specifically focusing on new insights obtained using novel technologies such as single-cell omics, organoid infection models and CRISPR screens. We describe how SARS-CoV-2 may infect the lower respiratory tract and cause alveolar damage as a result of dysfunctional immune responses. We discuss how this may lead to the induction of a ‘leaky state’ of both the epithelium and the endothelium, promoting inflammation and coagulation, while an influx of immune cells leads to overexuberant inflammatory responses and immunopathology. Finally, we highlight how these findings may aid the development of new therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020.
EXPOSURES: Documented NCIP.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked.
RESULTS: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3\%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29\%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3\%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6\%]), fatigue (96 [69.6\%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4\%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3\%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58\%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9\%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9\%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4\%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6\%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1\%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9\%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1\%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1\%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4\%]), and shock (11 [30.6\%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2\%] vs 38 [37.3\%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9\%] vs 20 [19.6\%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7\%] vs 31 [30.4\%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1\%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7\%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2\%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1\%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3\%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41\% of patients, 26\% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3\%.},

However, so far, the origin of the causative virus and its intermediate hosts is yet to be fully determined. SARS-CoV-2 contains nearly 30,000 letters of RNA that allows the virus to infect cells and hijack them to make new viruses. On the other hand, among 14 detected mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that provide advantages to virus for transmission and evasion form treatment, the D614G mutation (substitution of aspartic acid [D] with glycine [G] in codon 614 was particular which could provide the facilitation of the transmission of the virus and virulence. To date, in contrary to the global effort to come up with various aspects of SARS-CoV-2, there are still great pitfalls in the knowledge of this disease and many angles remain unclear. That's why, the monitoring and periodical investigation of this emerging infection in an epidemiological study seems to be essential. The present study characterizes the current epidemiological status (i.e., possible transmission route, mortality and morbidity risk, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and clinical feature) of the SARS-CoV-2 in the world during these pandemic.},

	abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {In the midst of the COVID-19 experience, we learned an important scientific lesson: knowledge acquisition and information quality in medicine depends more on “data quality” rather than “data quantity.” The large number of COVID-19 reports, published in a very short time, demonstrated that the most advanced statistical and computational tools cannot properly overcome the poor quality of acquired data. The main evidence for this observation comes from the poor reproducibility of results. Indeed, understanding the data generation process is fundamental when investigating scientific questions such as prevalence, immunity, transmissibility, and susceptibility. Most of COVID-19 studies are case reports based on “non probability” sampling and do not adhere to the general principles of controlled experimental designs. Such collected data suffers from many limitations when used to derive clinical conclusions. These include confounding factors, measurement errors and bias selection effects. Each of these elements represents a source of uncertainty, which is often ignored or assumed to provide an unbiased random contribution. Inference retrieved from large data in medicine is also affected by data protection policies that, while protecting patients’ privacy, are likely to reduce consistently usefulness of big data in achieving fundamental goals such as effective and efficient data-integration. This limits the degree of generalizability of scientific studies and leads to paradoxical and conflicting conclusions. We provide such examples from assessing the role of risks factors. In conclusion, new paradigms and new designs schemes are needed in order to reach inferential conclusions that are meaningful and informative when dealing with data collected during emergencies like COVID-19.},

The prognosis is described in terms of the proportion of individuals improved during the period of follow-up. Return to work, other medical illnesses and death as outcomes are also considered, as are variables which may influence prognosis.Results Twenty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria and, for the 14 studies of subjects meeting operational criteria for CFS, the median full recovery rate was 5\% (range 0–31\%) and the median proportion of patients who improved during follow-up was 39.5\% (range 8–63\%). Less fatigue severity at baseline, a sense of control over symptoms and not attributing illness to a physical cause were all associated with a good outcome. Return to work at follow-up ranged from 8 to 30\% in the three studies that considered this outcome.Conclusions Full recovery from untreated CFS is rare. The prognosis for an improvement in symptoms is less gloomy. This review looks at the course of CF/CFS without systematic intervention. However, there is increasing evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural and graded exercise therapies. Medical retirement should be postponed until a trial of such treatment has been given.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is still unknown. The identification of risk factors for CFS/ME is of great importance to practitioners.
METHOD: A systematic scoping review was conducted to locate studies that analysed risk factors for CFS/ME using multiple predictors. We searched for published and unpublished literature in 11 electronic databases, reference lists of retrieved articles and guideline stakeholder submissions in conjunction with the development of a forthcoming national UK guideline. Risk factors and findings were extracted in a concise tabular overview and studies synthesized narratively.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were identified that met inclusion criteria: two case-control studies, four cohort studies, three studies combining a cohort with a case-control study design, one case-control and twin study and one cross-sectional survey. The studies looked at a variety of demographic, medical, psychological, social and environmental factors to predict the development of CFS/ME. The existing body of evidence is characterized by factors that were analysed in several studies but without replication of a significant association in more than two studies, and by studies demonstrating significant associations of specific factors that were not assessed in other studies. None of the identified factors appear suitable for the timely identification of patients at risk of developing CFS/ME within clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Various potential risk factors for the development of CFS/ME have been assessed but definitive evidence that appears meaningful for clinicians is lacking.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by widespread persistent pain and the presence of multiple discrete tender points. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a syndrome characterized by debilitating fatigue associated with a variable number of non-specific complaints. Because neither condition had necessarily been recognized in children until recently, those patients have been treated as having school refusal without being diagnosed as having either syndrome. There is a considerable overlap of clinical symptoms between these two syndromes. It is therefore controversial as to whether these syndromes have the same pathogenesis or not. The aim of the present study was to clarify the relationship between these syndromes in children.
METHODS: Fifteen patients with FM and 21 patients with CFS were investigated both clinically and immunologically. Immunological assessments included thorough analysis of autoantibodies using several techniques.
RESULTS: Anti-nuclear antibody titers were higher and the prevalence of anti-Sa antibody was far more frequent in CFS patients than in FM patients.
CONCLUSION: CFS and FM are different from each other at least in childhood, from an immunological aspect, although some patients could have both conditions.},

Treatment with Isoprinosine resulted in significantly increased numbers of CD4+ T helper cells (p {\textgreater}0.03). Treatment with Isoprinosine for 12 weeks did not appreciably influence the in vitro production of IFN-y, IL-1oc, IL-10 or IL-12. However, IL-12 was significantly increased at week 28 (p {\textgreater}0.02) in patients who improved after treatment with Isoprinosine. These results suggest that taking Isoprinosine may benefit a subgroup of patients with CFS, and this clinical improvement is associated with enhanced NK cell function and IL-12 levels.

The underlying pathogenesis is unknown, but impairments in certain mitochondrial functions have been found in some CFS patients. To thoroughly reveal mitochondrial deficiencies in CFS patients, here we examine the key aspects of mitochondrial function in blood cells from a paired CFS patient-control series. Surprisingly, we discover that in patients the ATP levels are higher and mitochondrial cristae are more condensed compared to their paired controls, while the mitochondrial crista length, mitochondrial size, shape, density, membrane potential, and enzymatic activities of the complexes in the electron transport chain remain intact. We further show that the increased ATP largely comes from non-mitochondrial sources. Our results indicate that the fatigue symptom in this cohort of patients is unlikely caused by lack of ATP and severe mitochondrial malfunction. On the contrary, it might be linked to a pathological mechanism by which more ATP is produced by non-mitochondrial sources.},

The purpose of this paper is to compare the status of CD8+ T cells in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Methods. This preliminary investigation comprised 23 CFS/ME patients, 11 untreated MS patients, and 30 nonfatigued controls. Whole blood samples were collected from participants, stained with monoclonal antibodies, and analysed on the flow cytometer. Using the following CD markers, CD27 and CD45RA (CD45 exon isoform 4), CD8+ T cells were divided into naïve, central memory (CM), effector memory CD45RA− (EM), and effector memory CD45RA+ (EMRA) cells. Results. Surface expressions of BTLA, CD127, and CD49/CD29 were increased on subsets of CD8+ T cells from MS patients. In the CFS/ME patients CD127 was significantly decreased on all subsets of CD8+ T cells in comparison to the nonfatigued controls. PSGL-1 was significantly reduced in the CFS/ME patients in comparison to the nonfatigued controls. Conclusions. The results suggest significant deficits in the expression of receptors and adhesion molecules on subsets of CD8+ T cells in both MS and CFS/ME patients. These deficits reported may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. However, larger sample size is warranted to confirm and support these encouraging preliminary findings.},

	abstract = {Background
Patients with post-acute sequelae of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC, i.e., Long COVID) have a symptom complex highly analogous to many features of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting they may share some aspects of pathogenesis in these similar disorders. ME/CFS is a complex disease affecting numerous organ systems and biological processes and is often preceded by an infection-like episode. It is postulated that the chronic manifestations of illness may result from an altered host response to infection or inability to resolve inflammation, as is being reported in Long COVID. The immunopathogenesis of both disorders is still poorly understood. Here, we show data that suggest Long COVID and ME/CFS may be due to an aberrant response to an immunological trigger-like infection, resulting in a dysregulated immune system with CD8 T-cell dysfunction reminiscent of some aspects of T-cell clonal exhaustion, a phenomenon associated with oxidative stress. As there is an urgent need for diagnostic tools and treatment strategies for these two related disabling disorders, here, in a retrospective case series, we have also identified a potential nebulized antioxidant/anti-pathogen treatment that has evidence of a good safety profile. This nebulized agent is comprised of five ingredients previously reported individually to relieve oxidative stress, attenuate NF-κB signaling, and/or to act directly to inhibit pathogens, including viruses. Administration of this treatment by nebulizer results in rapid access of small doses of well-studied antioxidants and agents with anti-pathogen potential to the lungs; components of this nebulized agent are also likely to be distributed systemically, with potential to enter the central nervous system.
Methods
and Findings: We conducted an analysis of CD8 T-cell function and severity of symptoms by self-report questionnaires in ME/CFS, Long COVID and healthy controls. We developed a CD8 T-cell functional assay, assessing CD8 T-cell dysfunction by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) in a group of ME/CFS (n = 12) and Long COVID patients (n = 8), comparing to healthy controls (HC) with similar age and sex (n = 10). Magnet-enriched fresh CD8 T-cells in both patient groups had a significantly diminished capacity to produce both cytokines, IFNγ or TNFα, after PMA stimulation when compared to HC. The symptom severity questionnaire showed similar symptom profiles for the two disorders. Fortuitously, through a retrospective case series, we were able to examine the ICS and questionnaire data of 4 ME/CFS and 4 Long COVID patients in conjunction with their treatment (3–15 months). In parallel with the treatment pursued electively by participants in this retrospective case series, there was an increase in CD8 T-cell IFNγ and TNFα production and a decrease in overall self-reported symptom severity score by 54\%. No serious treatment-associated side effects or laboratory anomalies were noted in these patients.
Conclusions
Here, in this small study, we present two observations that appear potentially fundamental to the pathogenesis and treatment of Long COVID and ME/CFS. The first is that both disorders appear to be characterized by dysfunctional CD8 T-cells with severe deficiencies in their abilities to produce IFNγ and TNFα. The second is that in a small retrospective Long COVID and ME/CFS case series, this immune dysfunction and patient health improved in parallel with treatment with an immunomodulatory, antioxidant pharmacological treatment with anticipated anti-pathogen activity. This work provides evidence of the potential utility of a biomarker, CD8 T-cell dysfunction, and suggests the potential for benefit from a new nebulized antioxidant/anti-pathogen treatment. These immune biomarker data may help build capacity for improved diagnosis and tracking of treatment outcomes during clinical trials for both Long COVID and ME/CFS while providing clues to new treatment avenues that suggest potential efficacy for both conditions.},

	abstract = {Background: The levels of antibodies to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) have been compared to healthy controls in many studies. However, the results are inconsistent. Purpose: The objective of this systematic literature review was to determine whether differences in EBV serology between ME/CFS patients and controls vary with the case definition that is used. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and earlier reviews were searched for studies in which the serum levels of antibodies to EBV-antigens in ME/CFS patients were compared with those in persons without ME/CFS. Results: 27 studies were identified. The levels of antibodies to EBV in ME/CFS patients differed from those in controls in 14 studies. The differences in EBV serology that were revealed, were almost exclusively signs that may indicate higher EBV activity in the patient group. The serological differences between patients and controls were seen in the 2 studies in which ME/CFS was defined using the Canadian criteria, in 5 of the 9 studies using the Holmes criteria, in 1 of the 2 studies using modified Holmes criteria, in 2 of the 6 studies using the Fukuda criteria, and in 4 of the 7 studies using less known criteria. The single study using the Oxford criteria, showed no difference between cases and controls. Conclusions: There seems to be increased EBV activity in subset(s) of ME/CFS patients. The data do not allow firm conclusions about EBV antibody levels varying with the illness case definition used.},

To determine if ME/CFS is just a more extreme form of fatigue, or a qualitatively different condition, we assessed whether risk factors for ME/CFS and for Severe Fatigue were similar. An email questionnaire that inquired about symptoms of Severe Fatigue and ME/CFS was completed by 41,802 US female nurses from whom detailed medical and lifestyle information had been collected since 1989: 102 met criteria for ME/CFS, 522 had Severe Fatigue, and 41,178 individuals were without significant chronic fatigue. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the Hazard Ratio (HR) of Severe Fatigue and of ME/CFS with each of several potential risk factors, according to the level of exposure to each risk factor. The risk of Severe Fatigue was significantly increased among participants who were older, had a higher BMI in adulthood, used hormone therapy, had increased alcohol intake and decreased caffeine intake. In contrast, these risk factor associations were not seen in people with ME/CFS. A self-reported past history of acute infectious mononucleosis was associated with a non-significantly increased Hazard Ratio of later ME/CFS (HR 1.77, 0.87–3.61) and, to a lesser extent, of Severe Fatigue (HR 1.28, 0.98–1.66). The different contribution of various risk factors to Severe Fatigue and ME/CFS suggests that ME/CFS has a qualitatively different underlying biology from the more common state of Severe Fatigue.},

In 1995-1997, the authors conducted a health survey in which these two symptom-based medical diagnoses in a population-based sample of 15,000 Gulf War veterans representing four military branches and three unit components (active, reserve, and National Guard) were compared with those of 15,000 non-Gulf veteran controls. Gulf War veterans, compared with non-Gulf veteran controls, reported significantly higher rates of PTSD (adjusted odds ratio = 3.1, 95\% confidence interval: 2.7, 3.4) and CFS (adjusted odds ratio = 4.8, 95\% confidence interval: 3.9, 5.9). The prevalence of PTSD increased monotonically across six levels of deployment-related stress intensity (test for trend: p {\textless} 0.01), while the prevalence of CFS rose only at the low end of the stress spectrum. While deployment-related stress could account for the higher risks of both PTSD and CFS, additional factor(s) unique to the Gulf environment may have contributed to the risk of CFS among Gulf War veterans.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims: Comorbid or extraintestinal symptoms occur frequently with irritable bowel syndrome and account for up to three fourths of excess health care visits. This challenges the assumption that irritable bowel is a distinct disorder. The aims of this study were to (1) assess comorbidity in 3 areas: gastrointestinal disorders, psychiatric disorders, and nongastrointestinal somatic disorders; and (2) evaluate explanatory hypotheses. Methods: The scientific literature since 1966 in all languages cited in Medline was systematically reviewed. Results: Comorbidity with other functional gastrointestinal disorders is high and may be caused by shared pathophysiological mechanisms such as visceral hypersensitivity. Psychiatric disorders, especially major depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders, occur in up to 94\%. The nongastrointestinal nonpsychiatric disorders with the best-documented association are fibromyalgia (median of 49\% have IBS), chronic fatigue syndrome (51\%), temporomandibular joint disorder (64\%), and chronic pelvic pain (50\%). Conclusions: Multivariate statistical analyses suggest that these are distinct disorders and not manifestations of a common somatization disorder, but their strong comorbidity suggests a common feature important to their expression, which is most likely psychological. Some models explain the comorbidity of irritable bowel with other disorders by suggesting that each disorder is the manifestation of varying combinations of interacting physiological and psychological factors. An alternative hypothesis is that the irritable bowel diagnosis is applied to a heterogeneous group of patients, some of whom have a predominantly psychological etiology, whereas others have a predominantly biological etiology, and that the presence of multiple comorbid disorders is a marker for psychological influences on etiology.

Subjective manifestations of SS such as neurocognitive dysfunction and fatigue have been stressed by some observers. We have detected a large number of patients with unrecognized SS-like illness in a clinical specializing in CFS and believe the relationship to be more than casual. From January 1991 through April 1992, 172 patients were evaluated for CFS; the SS cohort consisted of 27 females (mean age, 41.9 years). Sixteen of these patients had previously been found to have CFS by a physician, and 11 were self-referred. All patients complained of severe, dominating, chronic fatigue. Complaints of myalgia were prominent; 20 of 27 patients met the criteria for fibromyalgia. Neurocognitive complaints and/or a history of neuropsychiatric disease was frequent. Results of Schirmer's test were abnormal for 16 of 27, and results of minor salivary-gland biopsy were abnormal for 20 of 25. Antibodies to nuclear antigen were present in 16 of 27, but anti-Ro was present in only 1 of 21.

In 19 patients with pSS, we assessed pSS symptom severity and disease activity via questionnaires as well as the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) for ME/CFS. Hand grip strength (HGS) and levels of α1-, α2-, β1-, β2-, M3- and M4-receptor-autoantibodies were measured. A subgroup of pSS patients exhibited severe fatigue and had higher severity of pain (p = 0.045), depression (p = 0.021) and sleep disturbances (p = 0.020) compared to those with less fatigue. Four of eighteen pSS patients fulfilled the CCC. HGS parameters strongly correlated with fatigue severity (p {\textless} 0.05), but strength fully recovered one hour after exertion in contrast to ME/CFS. Levels of β1-, β2- and M4-receptor-autoantibodies were elevated and correlated significantly with disease activity assessed by the ESSDAI (p {\textless} 0.05), but not fatigue severity. Only a minor subgroup of pSS patients fulfills the CCC, and post exertional malaise (PEM) is atypical, as it is primarily triggered by mental/emotional but not physical exertion. HGS assessment is an objective measure to assess overall fatigue severity.},

	abstract = {Background Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disabling disorder characterised by persistent fatigue with a typical age of diagnosis of 35–50 years. CFS does present in those aged over 50 but whether this is a different disease in older age groups has not been considered. Therefore, we performed a clinical cohort study to examine and differentiate the clinical and autonomic features in CFS patients aged over 50. Design A total of 179 Fukuda diagnosed CFS patients were recruited, and 25 older CFS patients (50 + years) were matched case by case for gender and length of history to 25 younger CFS patients (16–29 years). A range of symptomatic-based questionnaires were used in addition to heart rate variability and baroreceptor sensitivity to assess autonomic function. Results Chronic fatigue syndrome can present for the first time in an older population. Older CFS patients demonstrate increased fatigue (Fatigue impact scale; 85 ± 33 vs. 107 ± 27, P = 0·02) (Chalder fatigue scale; 9 ± 3 vs. 11 ± 1, P = 0·002) and caseness for depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale; 7 ± 3 vs. 10 ± 4; P = 0·005). There is a greater autonomic dysfunction in older CFS patients, with reduced parasympathetic function (HFnu; 49·1 ± 18 vs. 36·2 ± 18, P = 0·01, RR30 : 15; ± , P = 0·02) and increased sympathetic function (LFnu; 51·5 ± 17 vs. 63·8 ± 18, P = 0·01). Baroreflex sensitivity was substantially reduced (BRS; 19·7 ± 12 vs. 9·9 ± 5, P = 0·0004), and left ventricular ejection time prolonged (LVET; 274·6 ± 16 vs. 285·8 ± 9, P = 0·004). Conclusions Older CFS patients demonstrate a disease phenotype very different from younger patients. The combination of differing underlying pathogenic mechanisms and the physiological aspects of ageing result in a greater disease impact in older CFS patients.},

	abstract = {Endothelial cells are major participants in and regulators of inflammatory reactions.Resting endothelial cells prevent coagulation, control blood flow and passage of proteins from blood into tissues, and inhibit inflammation. Production of nitric oxide (NO) has a role in these processes and inadequate production of NO is a major cause of endothelial cell dysfunction.Type I activation of endothelial cells mediated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate G-protein αq subunits and cause endothelial cells to increase blood flow (enhancing delivery of leukocytes to the tissue), increase leakage of plasma proteins into the tissue (creating a provisional matrix to support leukocytes) and promote the binding and activation of neutrophils, encouraging their extravasation into an inflammatory site. Type I activation responses are rapid, independent of protein synthesis, and transient, spontaneously shutting off within 10–20 minutes.Type II activation of endothelial cells mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) also increase local blood flow, leakage of plasma proteins and recruit leukocytes. Type II activation responses depend on new gene transcription and protein translation, and are slower in onset but more sustained than type I activation responses, lasting for hours to days.Type-II-activated endothelial cells spontaneously evolve from a phenotype that recruits neutrophils to one that recruits monocytes and T cells. Polarizing cytokines, such as interferon-γ or IL-4 can further modify the activated endothelial cell phenotype to preferentially support T helper 1 (TH1)-cell- or TH2-cell-type inflammatory reactions, respectively.In chronic inflammation, endothelial cells respond to angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), to form new blood vessels that are required to sustain an inflammatory neo-tissue such as a pannus in rheumatoid arthritis. Endothelial cells may also respond to lymphotoxin-β to acquire characteristics of high endothelial venules and support the development of tertiary lymphoid organs.Many inflammatory processes display both acute and chronic changes at the same time. This may result because mediators of acute inflammation (such as TNF) contribute to the phenotypes of endothelial cells associated with chronic inflammatory and, similarly mediators of chronic inflammation (such as VEGFA) may also contribute to endothelial cell behaviours associated with acute inflammation.Many therapeutic agents thought to target inflammatory processes or vascular processes affect the inflammatory function of endothelial cells. Our deeper understanding of the mediators, signals and effector molecules involved in endothelial cell inflammatory functions may allow specific targeting of this cell type as a treatment for inflammatory diseases.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex multisystem disease. Evidence for disturbed vascular regulation comes from various studies showing cerebral hypoperfusion and orthostatic intolerance. The peripheral endothelial dysfunction (ED) has not been sufficiently investigated in patients with ME/CFS. The aim of the present study was to examine peripheral endothelial function in patients with ME/CFS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-five patients [median age 40 (range 18-70) years, mean body mass index 23.8 ± 4.2 kg/m2 , 31\% male] with ME/CFS were studied for peripheral endothelial function assessed by peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT2000). Clinical diagnosis of ME/CFS was based on Canadian Criteria. Nine of these patients with elevated antibodies against β2-adrenergic receptor underwent immunoadsorption, and endothelial function was measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. ED was defined by reactive hyperaemia index ≤1.81. Twenty healthy subjects of similar age and body mass index were used as a control group. Peripheral ED was found in 18 of 35 patients (51\%) with ME/CFS and in 4 healthy subjects (20\%, P {\textless} 0.05). Patients with ED, in contrast to patients with normal endothelial function, reported more severe disease according to Bell score (31 ± 12 vs. 40 ± 16, P = 0.04), as well as more severe fatigue-related symptoms (8.62 ± 0.87 vs. 7.75 ± 1.40, P = 0.04) including a higher demand for breaks [9.0 (interquartile range 7.0-10.0) vs. 7.5 (interquartile range 6.0-9.25), P = 0.04]. Peripheral ED showed correlations with more severe immune-associated symptoms (r = -0.41, P = 0.026), such as sore throat (r = -0.38, P = 0.038) and painful lymph nodes (r = -0.37, P = 0.042), as well as more severe disease according to Bell score (r = 0.41, P = 0.008) and symptom score (r = -0.59, P = 0.005). There were no differences between the patient group with ED and the patient group with normal endothelial function regarding demographic, metabolic, and laboratory parameters. Further, there was no difference in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule levels. At baseline, peripheral ED was observed in six patients who underwent immunoadsorption. After 12 months, endothelial function had improved in five of these six patients (reactive hyperaemia index 1.58 ± 0.15 vs. 2.02 ± 0.46, P = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral ED is frequent in patients with ME/CFS and associated with disease severity and severity of immune symptoms. As ED is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is important to elucidate if peripheral ED is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in ME/CFS.},

As the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is increasingly recognized as an inflammatory process, similarities between atherosclerosis and systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, lupus, psoriasis, spondyloarthritis and others have become a topic of interest. Endothelial dysfunction represents a key step in the initiation and maintenance of atherosclerosis and may serve as a marker for future risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases manifest endothelial dysfunction, often early in the course of the disease. Therefore, mechanisms linking systemic inflammatory diseases and atherosclerosis may be best understood at the level of the endothelium. Multiple factors, including circulating inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), reactive oxygen species, oxidized LDL (low density lipoprotein), autoantibodies and traditional risk factors directly and indirectly activate endothelial cells, leading to impaired vascular relaxation, increased leukocyte adhesion, increased endothelial permeability and generation of a pro-thrombotic state. Pharmacologic agents directed against TNF-α-mediated inflammation may decrease the risk of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease in these patients. Understanding the precise mechanisms driving endothelial dysfunction in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases may help elucidate the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in the general population.},

	abstract = {Objective
A few earlier studies have found impaired endothelial function in patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). The present study investigated large-vessel and small-vessel endothelial function in patients with ME/CFS.

Study design
The study was a substudy of the RituxME trial, a national, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study on the effect of rituximab vs. placebo in ME/CFS patients in Norway. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) was measured at baseline and after 18 months of treatment in 39 patients and compared with healthy controls. Other outcome measures were symptom severity and various physical function measures.

Results
ME/CFS patients had markedly reduced FMD compared to healthy controls at baseline (5.1\% vs. 8.2\%, p{\textless} 0.0001, adjusted for arterial diameter and sex), and significantly lower microvascular regulation measured by PORH than healthy controls (1354 PU vs. 2208 PU, p = 0.002). There were no differences between the treatment and placebo groups in symptom changes or vascular measures. As a group, the ME/CSF patients experienced a slight, but significant improvement in clinical symptoms after 18 months. PORH, but not FMD, was similarly improved (1360 to 1834 PU, p = 0.028). There was no significant correlation between FMD and PORH. There were non-significant tendencies towards associations between symptom severity/physical function measures and lower FMD and PORH, and a significant correlation between PORH and steps per 24 hours at baseline.

Conclusions
ME/CFS patients had reduced macro- and microvascular endothelial function, indicating that vascular homeostasis may play a role in the clinical presentation of this disease.},

	abstract = {Hypertension (HTN) is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide and is among the most important risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. It is currently thought to be the result of disturbances in a number of neural, renal, hormonal, and vascular mechanisms regulating blood pressure (BP), so crucial importance is given to the imbalance of a number of vasoactive factors produced by the endothelium. Decreased nitric oxide production and increased production of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the vascular wall may promote oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, with the development of endothelial dysfunction (ED) and increased vasoconstrictor activity. Increased ET-1 production can contribute to arterial aging and the development of atherosclerotic changes, which are associated with increased arterial stiffness and manifestation of isolated systolic HTN. In addition, ET-1 is involved in the complex regulation of BP through synergistic interactions with angiotensin II, regulates the production of catecholamines and sympathetic activity, affects renal hemodynamics and water–salt balance, and regulates baroreceptor activity and myocardial contractility. This review focuses on the relationship between ET-1 and HTN and in particular on the key role of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of ED, arterial structural changes, and impaired vascular regulation of BP. The information presented includes basic concepts on the role of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of HTN without going into detailed analyses, which allows it to be used by a wide range of specialists. Also, the main pathological processes and mechanisms are richly illustrated for better understanding.},

Dysfunction of the blood vessel endothelium could be an underlying biological mechanism, resulting in inability to fine-tune regulation of blood flow according to the metabolic demands of tissues. The objectives of the present study were to investigate endothelial function in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy individuals, and assess possible changes in endothelial function after intervention with IV cyclophosphamide. Methods: This substudy to the open-label phase II trial "Cyclophosphamide in ME/CFS" included 40 patients with mild-moderate to severe ME/CFS according to Canadian consensus criteria, aged 18-65 years. Endothelial function was measured by Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and Post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) at baseline and repeated after 12 months. Endothelial function at baseline was compared with two cohorts of healthy controls (N = 66 and N = 30) from previous studies. Changes in endothelial function after 12 months were assessed and correlated with clinical response to cyclophosphamide. Biological markers for endothelial function were measured in serum at baseline and compared with healthy controls (N = 30). Results: Baseline FMD was significantly reduced in patients (median FMD 5.9\%, range 0.5-13.1, n = 35) compared to healthy individuals (median FMD 7.7\%, range 0.7-21, n = 66) (p = 0.005), as was PORH with patient score median 1,331 p.u. (range 343-4,334) vs. healthy individuals 1,886 p.u. (range 808-8,158) (p = 0.003). No significant associations were found between clinical response to cyclophosphamide intervention (reported in 55\% of patients) and changes in FMD/PORH from baseline to 12 months. Serum levels of metabolites associated with endothelial dysfunction showed no significant differences between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. Conclusions: Patients with ME/CFS had reduced endothelial function affecting both large and small vessels compared to healthy controls. Changes in endothelial function did not follow clinical responses during follow-up after cyclophosphamide IV intervention.},

To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) of an ME/CFS cohort conducted to date. Here 442 SNPs were identified as candidates for association with ME/CFS (adjusted P-value{\textless}0.05). Whereas the majority of these SNPs are represented in non-coding regions of the genome, 12 SNPs were identified in the coding region of their respective gene. Among these, two candidate SNPs resulted in missense substitutions, one in a pattern recognition receptor and the other in an uncharacterized coiled-coil domain-containing protein. We also identified five SNPs that cluster in the non-coding regions of T-cell receptor loci. Further examination of these polymorphisms may help identify contributing factors to the pathophysiology of ME/CFS, as well as categorize potential targets for medical intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {Over several decades, various forms of genomic analysis of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been extremely successful in picking up many disease associations. This is to be expected, as the MHC region is one of the most gene-dense and polymorphic stretches of human DNA. It also encodes proteins critical to immunity, including several controlling antigen processing and presentation. Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) imputation now permit the screening of large sample sets, a technique further facilitated by high-throughput sequencing. These methods promise to yield more precise contributions of MHC variants to disease. However, interpretation of MHC-disease associations in terms of the functions of variants has been problematic. Most studies confirm the paramount importance of class I and class II molecules, which are key to resistance to infection. Infection is likely driving the extreme variation of these genes across the human population, but this has been difficult to demonstrate. In contrast, many associations with autoimmune conditions have been shown to be specific to certain class I and class II alleles. Interestingly, conditions other than infections and autoimmunity are also associated with the MHC, including some cancers and neuropathies. These associations could be indirect, owing, for example, to the infectious history of a particular individual and selective pressures operating at the population level.},

Aims: To investigate the role of HLA class II antigens in CFS.
Methods: Forty nine patients with CFS were genotyped for the HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 alleles and the frequency of these alleles was compared with a control group comprising 102 normal individuals from the UK. All patients and controls were from the same region of England and, apart from two patients, were white.
Results: Analysis by 2 × 2 contingency tables revealed an increased frequency of HLA-DQA1*01 alleles in patients with CFS (51.0\% v 35\%; odds ratio (OR), 1.93; p = 0.008). HLA-DQB1*06 was also increased in the patients with CFS (30.2\% v 20.0\%; OR, 1.73, p = 0.052). Only the association between HLA-DQA1*01 and CFS was significant in logistic regression models containing HLA-DQA1*01 and HLA-DRQB1*06, and this was independent of HLA-DRB1 alleles. There was a decreased expression of HLA-DRB1*11 in CFS, although this association disappeared after correction for multiple comparisons.
Conclusions: CFS may be associated with HLA-DQA1*01, although a role for other genes in linkage disequilibrium cannot be ruled out.},

The broad range of COVID-19’s bodily effects and responses after initial viral infection are also poorly understood.

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: The diagnosis and pathology of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) remain under debate. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an autoimmune component in ME/CFS caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and other viral infections. Materials and Methods: In this work, we analyzed a large public dataset on the IgG antibodies to 3054 EBV peptides to understand whether these immune responses could help diagnose patients and trigger pathological autoimmunity; we used healthy controls (HCs) as a comparator cohort. Subsequently, we aimed at predicting the disease status of the study participants using a super learner algorithm targeting an accuracy of 85\% when splitting data into train and test datasets. Results: When we compared the data of all ME/CFS patients or the data of a subgroup of those patients with non-infectious or unknown disease triggers to the data of the HC, we could not find an antibody-based classifier that would meet the desired accuracy in the test dataset. However, we could identify a 26-antibody classifier that could distinguish ME/CFS patients with an infectious disease trigger from the HCs with 100\% and 90\% accuracies in the train and test sets, respectively. We finally performed a bioinformatic analysis of the EBV peptides associated with these 26 antibodies. We found no correlation between the importance metric of the selected antibodies in the classifier and the maximal sequence homology between human proteins and each EBV peptide recognized by these antibodies. Conclusions: In conclusion, these 26 antibodies against EBV have an effective potential for disease diagnosis in a subset of patients. However, the peptides associated with these antibodies are less likely to induce autoimmune B-cell responses that could explain the pathogenesis of ME/CFS.},

There have been district epidemics, in which the male: female ratio was almost even and several male outbreaks affecting soldiers in barracks. Some outbreaks appear to have been triggered off by an epidemic of poliomyelitis, and the epidemiology of outbreaks in Iceland in 1948 and 1955 suggests that the normal cytopathological effects of poliomyelitis infection have been suppressed by the new disease. In the Durban epidemic (1955) a toxic metabolite was discovered in the urine of many patients and a markedly increased urinary excretion of creatine was noted in two New York State outbreaks. The results of the transmission of an agent from patients with ENM to monkeys suggest that the neurological disorder might be in the form of mild disseminated lesions scattered throughout the nervous system from the brain to peripheral nerves and associated with perivascular round cell infiltration without significant cellular damage. ENM infection was widespread in the North of England in 1955 and associated with lymphocyte abnormalities, which have persisted in some cases for several years. This suggests a continuous organic process.},

Using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan, this study evaluated the association between herpes zoster (HZ) infection and the risk of CFS, and examined the possibility of patients developing postviral fatigue effects, including the possibility of developing other unexplainable chronic fatigue conditions. In this prospective cohort study using the NHIRD, we identified 9,205 patients with HZ infection [ICD-9 (International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision), code 053] and 36,820 patients without HZ infection (non-HZ) from 2005 to 2007, and followed up to the end of 2010. The incidence rate of CFS was higher in the HZ cohort than in the non-HZ cohort (4.56 vs. 3.44 per 1,000 person-years), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.29 [95 \% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09-1.53]. It was shown that the risk of CFS without comorbidity for each patient increased from 1.25- to 1.36-fold between the CFS and non-CFS cohorts; with long-term follow-up, the HZ cohort showed a significantly higher cumulative incidence rate of developing CFS than the non-HZ patients. We propose that patients with chronic fatigue might exist in a subset of patients that would be associated with HZ infection. The actual mechanism of development of CFS that is attributed to HZ infection remains unclear. The findings of this population cohort study provide pivotal evidence of postviral fatigue among patients with HZ infection.},

An immune system that has been compromised, could account for HSV reactivating or infecting for the first time, and also being insufficiently under control in the body. Another consequence of inadequate control could be that several strains of HSV could simultaneously infect the body. Objectives: To look for the presence of antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2 in patients with CSF and in controls. The presence of antibodies to both types of HSV could reflect infection by multiple strains of HSV. Methods: Antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2 were measured in sera from 27 CSF patients and 26 age-and sex-matched controls. CFS was diagnosed using the CDC criteria. Results: More CFS patients had antibodies to HSV-1, HSV-2 and both types simultaneously, than did the controls (all p {\textless} .019). Conclusions: More CFS patients have antibodies to both HSV-1 and HSV-2 than do controls. The possibility that multiple strains could recombine to form more virulent strains or ones able to cause different forms of illness is discussed.},

	abstract = {The clinical implications of COVID-19 have changed since SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in humans. The current high levels of population immunity, due to prior infection and/or vaccination, have been associated with a vastly decreased overall risk of severe disease. Some people, particularly those with immunocompromising conditions, remain at risk for severe outcomes. Through the course of the pandemic, variants with somewhat different symptom profiles from the original SARS-CoV-2 virus have emerged. The management of COVID-19 has also changed since 2020, with the increasing availability of evidence-based treatments in two main classes: antivirals and immunomodulators. Selecting the appropriate treatment(s) for patients with COVID-19 requires a deep understanding of the evidence and an awareness of the limitations of applying data that have been largely based on immune-naive populations to patients today who most likely have vaccine-derived and/or infection-derived immunity. In this Review, we provide a summary of the clinical manifestations and approaches to caring for adult patients with COVID-19 in the era of vaccine availability and the dominance of the Omicron subvariants, with a focus on the management of COVID-19 in different patient groups, including immunocompromised, pregnant, vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.},

Inclusion criteria were confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a history of solid or hematologic cancer.
EXPOSURES: SARS-CoV-2 infection.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Deaths were differentiated at 14 days and 3 months as the 2 landmark end points. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared by stratifying patients across 5 phases (February to March 2020, April to June 2020, July to September 2020, October to December 2020, and January to February 2021) and across 2 major outbreaks (February to June 2020 and July 2020 to February 2021).
RESULTS: At data cutoff, 2795 consecutive patients were included, with 2634 patients eligible for analysis (median [IQR] age, 68 [18-77] years ; 52.8\% men). Eligible patients demonstrated significant time-dependent improvement in 14-day case-fatality rate (CFR) with estimates of 29.8\% (95\% CI, 0.26-0.33) for February to March 2020; 20.3\% (95\% CI, 0.17-0.23) for April to June 2020; 12.5\% (95\% CI, 0.06-22.90) for July to September 2020; 17.2\% (95\% CI, 0.15-0.21) for October to December 2020; and 14.5\% (95\% CI, 0.09-0.21) for January to February 2021 (all P {\textless} .001) across the predefined phases. Compared with the second major outbreak, patients diagnosed in the first outbreak were more likely to be 65 years or older (974 of 1626 [60.3\%] vs 564 of 1008 [56.1\%]; P = .03), have at least 2 comorbidities (793 of 1626 [48.8\%] vs 427 of 1008 [42.4\%]; P = .001), and have advanced tumors (708 of 1626 [46.4\%] vs 536 of 1008 [56.1\%]; P {\textless} .001). Complications of COVID-19 were more likely to be seen (738 of 1626 [45.4\%] vs 342 of 1008 [33.9\%]; P {\textless} .001) and require hospitalization (969 of 1626 [59.8\%] vs 418 of 1008 [42.1\%]; P {\textless} .001) and anti-COVID-19 therapy (1004 of 1626 [61.7\%] vs 501 of 1008 [49.7\%]; P {\textless} .001) during the first major outbreak. The 14-day CFRs for the first and second major outbreaks were 25.6\% (95\% CI, 0.23-0.28) vs 16.2\% (95\% CI, 0.13-0.19; P {\textless} .001), respectively. After adjusting for country, sex, age, comorbidities, tumor stage and status, anti-COVID-19 and anticancer therapy, and COVID-19 complications, patients diagnosed in the first outbreak had an increased risk of death at 14 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.85; 95\% CI, 1.47-2.32) and 3 months (HR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.51) compared with those diagnosed in the second outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this registry-based study suggest that mortality in patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 has improved in Europe; this improvement may be associated with earlier diagnosis, improved management, and dynamic changes in community transmission over time.},

Here, we demonstrated that miR-21 expression is elevated in Th17 cells and that mice lacking miR-21 have a defect in Th17 differentiation and are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Furthermore, we determined that miR-21 promotes Th17 differentiation by targeting and depleting SMAD-7, a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. Moreover, the decreases in Th17 differentiation in miR-21-deficient T cells were associated with defects in SMAD-2/3 activation and IL-2 suppression. Finally, we found that treatment of WT mice with an anti-miR-21 oligonucleotide reduced the clinical severity of EAE, which was associated with a decrease in Th17 cells. Thus, we have characterized a T cell-intrinsic miRNA pathway that enhances TGF-β signaling, limits the autocrine inhibitory effects of IL-2, and thereby promotes Th17 differentiation and autoimmunity.},

Contemporary science indicates that genetics is partly responsible for disease development, while environmental and stochastic factors also play a role. Among the many genes that increase the risk of autoimmune conditions, the risk allele encoding the W620 variant of protein tyrosine phosphatase N22 (PTPN22) is shared between multiple rheumatic diseases, suggesting that it plays a fundamental role in the development of immune dysfunction. Herein, we discuss how the presence of the PTPN22 risk allele may shape the signs and symptoms of these diseases. Besides the emerging clarity regarding how PTPN22 tunes T and B cell antigen receptor signaling, we discuss recent discoveries of important functions of PTPN22 in myeloid cell lineages. Taken together, these new insights reveal important clues to the molecular mechanisms of prevalent diseases like RA and lupus and may open new avenues for the development of personalized therapies that spare the normal function of the immune system.},

	abstract = {In the mammalian genome, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism involving the transfer of a methyl group onto the C5 position of the cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine. DNA methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting proteins involved in gene repression or by inhibiting the binding of transcription factor(s) to DNA. During development, the pattern of DNA methylation in the genome changes as a result of a dynamic process involving both de novo DNA methylation and demethylation. As a consequence, differentiated cells develop a stable and unique DNA methylation pattern that regulates tissue-specific gene transcription. In this chapter, we will review the process of DNA methylation and demethylation in the nervous system. We will describe the DNA (de)methylation machinery and its association with other epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and noncoding RNAs. Intriguingly, postmitotic neurons still express DNA methyltransferases and components involved in DNA demethylation. Moreover, neuronal activity can modulate their pattern of DNA methylation in response to physiological and environmental stimuli. The precise regulation of DNA methylation is essential for normal cognitive function. Indeed, when DNA methylation is altered as a result of developmental mutations or environmental risk factors, such as drug exposure and neural injury, mental impairment is a common side effect. The investigation into DNA methylation continues to show a rich and complex picture about epigenetic gene regulation in the central nervous system and provides possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Objective: Methylation is known to regulate biological processes and alterations in methylation patterns have been associated with a variety of diseases. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is an unexplained disorder associated with immunological and molecular changes. CD4+T cells specifically, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been implicated in CFS/ME patients where significant increases in Tregs have been observed in these patients. Therefore the objective of this study was to examine methylation in CD4+T cells from CFS/ME patients. Methods: The study comprised twenty-five CFS/ME participants and eighteen controls aged between 25-60 years. A volume of 20 ml whole blood was collected from each participant and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated via density gradient centrifugation. A negative isolation kit was used to isolate the CD4+T cells from the peripheral blood samples. Genome wide methylation studies were performed on isolated CD4+T cells using the Illumina Infinium 450 K Human methylation array system. Data analysis was performed using Genome studio and Partek Enrichment software. Results: 120 CpGs were observed to be differentially methylated in the CFS/ME patients in comparison to the controls. Of these 70 were associated with known genes. The majority of the differential methylated regions in the CFS/ME patients were hypomethylated. Additionally, most of the genes with differentially methylated regions in the CFS/ME patients were responsible for apoptosis, cell development, cell function and metabolic activity. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that epigenetic changes in CD4+T cells may have a potential role in the immunological changes observed in CFS/ME patients.},

Here we investigate the potential association of MDSCs with the disease pathogenesis using a preclinical model of RA and specimen collected from patients with RA.
Methods The frequency of MDSCs in blood, lymphoid tissues, inflamed paws or synovial fluid and their association with disease severity, tissue inflammation and the levels of pathogenic T helper (Th) 17 cells were examined in arthritic mice or in patients with RA (n=35) and osteoarthritis (n=15). The MDSCs in arthritic mice were also characterised for their phenotype, inflammation status, T cell suppressive activity and their capacity of pro-Th17 cell differentiation. The involvement of MDSCs in the disease pathology and a Th17 response was examined by adoptive transfer or antibody depletion of MDSCs in arthritic mice or by coculturing mouse or human MDSCs with naïve CD4+ T cells under Th17-polarising conditions.
Results MDSCs significantly expanded in arthritic mice and in patients with RA, which correlated positively with disease severity and an inflammatory Th17 response. While displaying T cell suppressive activity, MDSCs from arthritic mice produced high levels of inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin (IL)-1β, TNF-α). Mouse and human MDSCs promoted Th17 cell polarisation ex vivo. Transfer of MDSCs facilitated disease progression, whereas their elimination in arthritic mice ameliorated disease symptoms concomitant with reduction of IL-17A/Th17 cells.
Conclusions Our studies suggest that proinflammatory MDSCs with their capacity to drive Th17 cell differentiation may be a critical pathogenic factor in autoimmune arthritis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) appears to develop in genetically susceptible individuals as a result of environmental exposures. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is an almost universal finding among individuals with MS. Symptomatic EBV infection as manifested by infectious mononucleosis (IM) has been shown in a previous meta-analysis to be associated with the risk of MS, however a number of much larger studies have since been published.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a Medline search to identify articles published since the original meta-analysis investigating MS risk following IM. A total of 18 articles were included in this study, including 19390 MS patients and 16007 controls. We calculated the relative risk of MS following IM using a generic inverse variance with random effects model. This showed that the risk of MS was strongly associated with IM (relative risk (RR) 2.17; 95\% confidence interval 1.97-2.39; p{\textless}10(-54)).
DISCUSSION: Our results establish firmly that a history of infectious mononucleosis significantly increases the risk of multiple sclerosis. Future work should focus on the mechanism of this association and interaction with other risk factors.},

We consider the economic case for prevention programmes, whether there is scope for preventive programmes for ME/CFS, and what are the health and economic benefits to be derived from the implementation of such programmes. We conclude that there is little scope for primary prevention programmes, given that ME/CFS is attributable to a combination of host and environmental risk factors, with host factors appearing to be most prominent, and that there are few identified modifiable risk factors that could be the focus of such programmes. The exception is in the use of agricultural chemicals, particularly organophosphates, where there is scope for intervention, and where Europe-wide programmes of health education to encourage safe use would be beneficial. There is a need for more research on risk factors for ME/CFS to establish a basis for the development of primary prevention programmes, particularly in respect of occupational risk factors. Secondary prevention offers the greatest scope for intervention, to minimise diagnostic delays associated with prolonged illness, increased severity, and increased costs.},

	abstract = {The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in significant casualties and put immense strain on public health systems worldwide, leading to economic recession and social unrest. In response, various prevention and control strategies have been implemented globally, including vaccine and drug development and the promotion of preventive measures. Implementing these strategies has effectively curbed the transmission of the virus, reduced infection rates, and gradually restored normal social and economic activities. However, the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 have led to inevitable infections and reinfections, and the number of deaths continues to rise. Therefore, there is still a need to improve existing prevention and control strategies, mainly focusing on developing novel vaccines and drugs, expediting medical authorization processes, and keeping epidemic surveillance. These measures are crucial to combat the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and achieve sustained, long-term prevention, management, and disease control. Here, we summarized the characteristics of existing COVID-19 vaccines and drugs and suggested potential future directions for their development. Furthermore, we discussed the COVID-19-related policies implemented over the past years and presented some strategies for the future.},

Effectiveness in preventing hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths was more prominent than that in preventing COVID-19. A third dose inherited the effectiveness against non-variants of concern and increased effectiveness against severe COVID-19 outcomes caused by omicron variants compared to two doses. Most adverse reactions were mild. Few vaccine-related serious adverse reactions have been reported. Moreover, three-dose regimen significantly increased the seroconversion levels of neutralizing antibodies against omicron as compared to two-dose regimen.

To conduct this review, we adopt a novel methodology that consists of three phases. The first phase deploys a bibliometric analysis; the second phase concentrates on a network analysis; and the last phase proposes a refined literature review based on the results obtained by the previous two phases. The quantitative techniques utilized to conduct the first two phases allow describing the evolution of the research in this area and its potential ramifications in future.

	abstract = {The causes of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) remain unknown, with many failures to replicate new findings. This may be because the condition is hard to diagnose, difficult to classify, or because of its heterogeneous nature. Authors have problems in differentiating CFS from myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), which leads many to label it as a hybrid CFS/ME or ME/CFS. Attempts to validate the many published criterion-based definitions have ended in failure. The International Classification of Diseases provide several different descriptions to choose from, although the latest 11th edition has narrowed this down. This paper describes conventional attempts to define and classify the illness, suggesting that this may be what leads to a failure to replicate putative causes. The approach to CFS/ME may require a shift in the assumption that the illness is homogeneous. An alternative approach is provided by studies suggesting that the condition is heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: The way forward may be to be over-inclusive regarding the diagnosis as a first step, while subdividing the condition into likely subgroups as a means of finding valid and reliable associations with potential causes. Studies of aetiology must involve prospective designs since cross-sectional studies cannot inform either aetiology or pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate correlates of fatigue among individuals with RA and OA, including mood, sleep, disease activity and radiographic damage.
METHODS: Fatigue was assessed using the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue-Global Fatigue Index (MAF-GFI) in 103 patients with RA and 103 with OA. Sleep disturbance and pain were assessed using a visual analogue scale anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and disability using the HAQ. In the RA cohort, the disease activity score-28 joint count (DAS-28) and the Van der Heijde modified Sharp score were calculated, and in the OA cohort, the Kellgren-Lawrence score and the WOMAC score calculated.
RESULTS: The MAF-GFI scores were higher in the OA cohort (P = 0.02). This was not significant after controlling for disability (P = 0.59). OA participants reported greater pain, disability, depression and sleeplessness than those with RA (all P {\textless} 0.01). The strongest correlates of fatigue in the RA cohort were depression (P {\textless} 0.001) and anxiety (P {\textless} 0.001). There was no significant association with pain (P = 0.43), DAS-28 (P = 0.07), HAQ (P = 0.10) or Sharp score (P = 0.78). In OA, the correlates of fatigue were older age (P = 0.02), sleep disturbance (P = 0.03), depression (P = 0.04), disability (P = 0.04) and lower CRP (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is common and severe in both RA and OA. In RA, fatigue had no significant association with pain, disease activity, disability or erosions, but was associated with depression and anxiety. The disparity in correlates indicates that generalizing the experience of fatigue between OA and RA is not appropriate. Fatigue is an important domain in the assessment of disease impact.},

	doi = {10.1186/s41927-022-00299-3},
	abstract = {Background
The 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) is a widely used measure to assess disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The DAS28-P index, a derived proportion of the patient-reported components (joint tenderness and patient global assessment) within the DAS28, has been utilized as a discriminatory measure of non-inflammatory pain mechanisms in RA. This study aimed to evaluate the use of the DAS28-P index as a predictor of treatment response in early RA.


Methods
Patients with early RA enrolled in a supplemental fish oil clinical trial received a combination of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) according to a ‘treat-to-target’ protocol. First, consecutive measures of the DAS28-P index, derived from the DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), at each visit over a 1-year period were estimated for each patient. Then, distinct subgroups of treatment responders based on the trajectories of the DAS28-P indices were identified using bivariate k-means cluster analysis. Data on baseline predictors as well as longitudinal outcomes of disease impact and DMARD use over a 1-year period and radiographic progression over a 3-year period were collected and analyzed using a random intercept, population-averaged generalized estimating equation model.


Results
121 patients were included (74\% female; mean age of 57; median of 16 weeks of active disease) and a 3-cluster model was identified—the ‘Responders’ group (n = 58; 48\%), the ‘Partial Responders’ group (n = 32; 26\%), and the ‘Non-Responders’ group (n = 31; 26\%). The ‘Partial Responders’ group had consistently higher proportions of the DAS28-P index throughout the study period and had minimal radiographic progression over time, with the lowest joint erosion score of 0.9 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.2, 1.6], observed at the 3-year follow-up. At 52 weeks, the methotrexate dose was higher for both ‘Partial Responders’ and ‘Non-Responders’ groups (18.5 mg [95\% CI 15.5, 21.5] and 18.6 mg [95\% CI 15.3, 21.8] respectively), when compared with the ‘Responders’ group (12.8 mg [95\% CI 14.7, 20.9]).


Conclusions
Persistently high DAS28-P index scores are useful to distinguish poor patient global assessment and excessive treatment escalation in early RA, suggestive of underlying non-inflammatory pain contributing to higher disease activity score. Early identification of patients with discordant subjective and objective components of composite disease activity measures may allow better tailoring of treatment in RA.},

Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is suitable for measuring brain metabolites linked to inflammation, but has only been applied to discrete regions of interest in ME/CFS. We extended the MRS analysis of ME/CFS by capturing multi-voxel information across the entire brain. Additionally, we tested whether MRS-derived brain temperature is elevated in ME/CFS patients. Fifteen women with ME/CFS and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls completed fatigue and mood symptom questionnaires and whole-brain echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI). Choline (CHO), myo-inositol (MI), lactate (LAC), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were quantified in 47 regions, expressed as ratios over creatine (CR), and compared between ME/CFS patients and controls using independent-samples t-tests. Brain temperature was similarly tested between groups. Significant between-group differences were detected in several regions, most notably elevated CHO/CR in the left anterior cingulate (p {\textless} 0.001). Metabolite ratios in seven regions were correlated with fatigue (p {\textless} 0.05). ME/CFS patients had increased temperature in the right insula, putamen, frontal cortex, thalamus, and the cerebellum (all p {\textless} 0.05), which was not attributable to increased body temperature or differences in cerebral perfusion. Brain temperature increases converged with elevated LAC/CR in the right insula, right thalamus, and cerebellum (all p {\textless} 0.05).

This study used whole-brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to investigate whether abnormal inflammatory activity in the central nervous system may be associated with such symptoms. We hypothesized that RA patients would show higher brain choline (CHO), myo-inositol (MI), and lactate (LAC), and higher brain temperature than healthy controls. We further hypothesized that the metabolite levels would be positively correlated with self-reported fatigue.

Method
Thirteen women with RA provided fatigue severity ratings and underwent whole-brain MRSI and a joint examination. Thirteen healthy controls (HC) provided comparison imaging and fatigue data. CHO, MI, LAC, and brain temperature in 47 brain regions were contrasted between groups using independent-samples t tests. Significant differences were determined using a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p value threshold of ≤ 0.0023. Secondary analyses obtained correlations between imaging and clinical outcomes in the RA group.

Results
No brain metabolic differences were identified between the groups. In the RA group, fatigue severity was positively correlated with CHO in several brain regions—most strongly the right frontal lobe (rs = 0.823, p {\textless} 0.001). MI was similarly correlated with fatigue, particularly in the right calcarine fissure (rs = 0.829, p {\textless} 0.001). CHO in several regions was positively correlated with joint swelling and tenderness.

Conclusions
We conclude that abnormal brain metabolites are not a common feature of RA, but may been seen in patients with persistent fatigue or disease activity after conventional treatment.Key Points• Whole-brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no metabolic abnormalities in the brain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.• Brain choline levels were correlated with fatigue severity reported by RA patients and with peripheral joint swelling and tenderness.• Brain myo-inositol levels were similarly correlated with fatigue severity in RA patients.

RECENT FINDINGS: Severe fatigue is common among individuals with RA and has a significant impact on quality of life (QOL). RA-related factors (e.g., inflammation, pain) are associated with greater fatigue, but other factors, such as obesity, physical inactivity, sleep disturbance, and depression, explain the majority of variation in fatigue. Medications targeting RA have little effect on fatigue. Instead, the most effective interventions seem to address non-RA-specific factors such as physical inactivity or use cognitive behavioral approaches. No recommendations have been made for tools to measure fatigue in RA, leading to potential difficulty comparing studies. Although fatigue has great impact on patients' QOL, effective interventions that are feasible for broad dissemination remain elusive. Additional multi-faceted research is needed to identify modifiable sources of fatigue. Such research would be enhanced by harmonization of fatigue measurement across studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease characterized by decreased daily activity and persistent fatigue after physical and/or cognitive exertion. Although ME/CFS affects both sexes, there is a higher preponderance of cases in women. However, endocrinological studies focused on evaluating this sex-related disparity are limited. In this scenario, the aim of this study was to measure 9 circulating steroid hormones (SHs) divided into mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), glucocorticoids (cortisol, corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisone), androgens (androstenedione, testosterone), and progestins (progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone) in plasma samples from mild/moderate (ME/CFSmm; females, n=20; males, n=8), severely affected patients (ME/CFSsa; females, n=24; males, n=6), and healthy controls (HC, females, n=12; males, n=17) using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). After correction for multiple testing, we observed that circulating levels of 11-deoxycortisol, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in females, and progesterone in males were significantly different between HC, ME/CFSmm and ME/CFSsa. Comparing two independent groups, we found that female ME/CFSsa had higher levels of 11-deoxycortisol (vs. HC and ME/CFSmm) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (vs. HC). In addition, female ME/CFSmm showed a significant increase in progesterone levels relative to HC. In contrast, we observed that male ME/CFSmm had lower circulating levels of cortisol and corticosterone, while progesterone levels were elevated compared to HC. In addition to these univariate analyses, our correlational and multivariate approaches identified differential associations between our study groups. Also, using two-component partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), we were able to discriminate ME/CFS from HC with an accuracy of 0.712 and 0.846 for females and males, respectively. In conclusion, our findings not only suggest the potential value of including SHs in future studies aimed at improving stratification in ME/CFS, but also provide new perspectives to explore the clinical relevance of these SH-related differences within specific patient subgroups.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have higher pain and worse functional outcomes compared to men, even when treated with similar medications. The objective of this study was to identify sex differences in pain intensity, pain interference, and quantitative sensory tests (QST), which are independent of inflammation, in patients with RA.
METHODS: This study is a post hoc analysis of participants in the Central Pain in Rheumatoid Arthritis cohort. Pain intensity was assessed using a 0-10 numeric rating scale. Pain interference was measured using a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computerized adaptive test. QST included pressure pain detection thresholds, temporal summation, and conditioned pain modulation. Women and men were compared using multiple linear regression, adjusted for age, education, race, research site, depression, obesity, RA disease duration, swollen joint count, and C-reactive protein.
RESULTS: Mean ± SD pain intensity was 5.32 ± 2.29 among women with RA, compared to 4.60 ± 2.23 among men with RA (adjusted difference 0.83 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.14, 1.53]). Women with RA had lower pressure pain detection thresholds at the trapezius (adjusted difference -1.22 [95\% CI -1.73, -0.72]), wrist (adjusted difference -0.57 [95\% CI -1.07, -0.06]), and knee (adjusted difference -1.10 [95\% CI -2.00, -0.21]). No statistically significant differences in pain interference, temporal summation, and conditioned pain modulation were observed.
CONCLUSION: Women reported higher pain intensity and lower pressure pain detection thresholds (higher pain sensitivity) than men. However, pain interference, temporal summation, and conditioned pain modulation did not differ between men and women.},

The ME/CFS group showed high self-report fatigue and impaired physical function, whereas healthy controls did not show fatigue or function abnormalities. In patients, no significant post-exercise changes were found for heart rate variability (HRV); however, heart rate decreased in ME/CFS males from Day 14 to Day 15 (p = 0.046). Female patients showed increased fatigue (p = 0.006) after the initial walk test, but a downward slope (p = 0.008) in fatigue following the second walk test. Male patients showed a decrease in self-report work limitation in the days after exercise (p = 0.046). The healthy control group evidenced a decrease in HRV after the walk tests from Day 9–14 (p = 0.038). This pilot study did not confirm hypotheses that females as compared to males would show slower exercise recovery on autonomic or self-report (e.g. fatigue) measures.

	abstract = {Introduction
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex multisystem disease characterised by severe and disabling new-onset symptoms of post-exertional malaise (PEM), fatigue, brain fog, and sleep dysfunction that lasts for at least six months. Accumulating evidence suggests that sex and endocrine events have a significant influence on symptom onset and moderation of ME/CFS, with female sex being one of the most consistent and credible predictive risk factors associated with diagnosis. Such sex differences suggest sex chromosomes and sex steroids may play a part in the development of the condition or moderation of symptoms, although this has yet to be explored in detail.
Methods/Aims
This narrative review outlines sex differences in ME/CFS in terms of vulnerability factors and clinical phenotype and explores the known sex differences in neuroendocrine systems affected in ME/CFS and how this may relate to disease risk, onset, pathophysiology, and potential treatment avenues.
Conclusions
There is clear evidence of a sex dimorphism with regards to prevalence (3:1 female preponderance), clinical phenotypes, and aetiological triggers prior to symptom onset of ME/CFS. Endocrinological events, particularly those throughout the female lifespan, are associated with ME/CFS and include reproductive menstrual cycle fluctuations, pregnancy, post-partum and perimenopause. Further, there is evidence for gonadal sex, adrenal stress and renal neuroendocrine systems as implicated in ME/CFS, including changes in estrogen, progesterone compounds, aldosterone, and cortisol levels, of which there are established sex differences. The broad effects of steroid hormones on the physiological systems may also speak to the diversity of ME/CFS symptomatology observed in patients. Further attention must be paid to sex, age, and steroid biology in ME/CFS.},

	abstract = {Purpose Multiple clinical and epidemiological studies have provided estimates of fibromyalgia prevalence and sex ratio, but different criteria sets and methodology, as well as bias, have led to widely varying (0.4\%-{\textgreater}11\%) estimates of prevalence and female predominance ({\textgreater}90\% to {\textless}61\%). In general, studies have failed to distinguish Criteria based fibromyalgia (CritFM) from Clinical fibromyalgia (ClinFM). In the current study we compare CritFM with ClinFM to investigate gender and other biases in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Methods We used a rheumatic disease databank and 2016 fibromyalgia criteria to study prevalence and sex ratios in a selection biased sample of 1761 referred and diagnosed fibromyalgia patients and in an unbiased sample of 4342 patients with no diagnosis with respect to fibromyalgia. We compared diagnostic and clinical variables according to gender, and we reanalyzed a German population study (GPS) (n = 2435) using revised 2016 criteria for fibromyalgia. Results In the selection-biased sample of referred patients with fibromyalgia, more than 90\% were women. However, when an unselected sample of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was studied for the presence of fibromyalgia, women represented 58.7\% of fibromyalgia cases. Women had slightly more symptoms than men, including generalized pain (36.8\% vs. 32.4\%), count of 37 symptoms (4.7 vs. 3.7) and mean polysymptomatic distress scores (10.2 vs. 8.2). We also found a linear relation between the probability of being females and fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia severity. Women in the GPS represented 59.2\% of cases. Discussion The perception of fibromyalgia as almost exclusively (≥90\%) a women’s disorder is not supported by data in unbiased studies. Using validated self-report criteria and unbiased selection, the female proportion of fibromyalgia cases was ≤60\% in the unbiased studies, and the observed CritFM prevalence of fibromyalgia in the GPS was {\textasciitilde}2\%. ClinFM is the public face of fibromyalgia, but is severely affected by selection and confirmation bias in the clinic and publications, underestimating men with fibromyalgia and overestimating women. We recommend the use of 2016 fibromyalgia criteria for clinical diagnosis and epidemiology because of its updated scoring and generalized pain requirement. Fibromyalgia and generalized pain positivity, widespread pain (WPI), symptom severity scale (SSS) and polysymptomatic distress (PSD) scale should always be reported.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) routinely display differences in symptomatology, as well as illness course, onset, duration, and functional disability. Given such diversity, previous work has attempted to identify symptom-based ME/CFS subtypes. However, results have been inconsistent.
PURPOSE: This study sought to elucidate potential subtypes of ME/CFS as well as explore the impact of subtype membership on health functioning.
METHODS: Twelve non-core (i.e., less frequently endorsed) symptoms were included in a latent class analysis of 1,210 adults with ME/CFS. Demographic and illness-related predictors of class membership were evaluated with a multinomial logistic regression. ANOVAs were then performed to determine if there were significant differences across class on the eight subscales of the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).
RESULTS: A six-class solution was selected, which consisted of one class that was likely to endorse all non-core symptoms, one class that was unlikely to endorse any non-core symptoms, and four classes that were likely to endorse either one or two non-core symptom domains (i.e., circulatory/neuroendocrine impairment, orthostatic intolerance, and gastro-intestinal distress). Significant functioning differences by class were present for all SF-36 subscales.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are suggestive of subtypes of ME/CFS and, if replicated, may assist physicians in providing tailored treatment to patients and allow researchers to form more homogeneous samples.},

The activation of inflammatory processes and host immune responses cause chronic damage resulting in alterations of neuronal function and viability, but different pathogens can also directly trigger neurotoxic pathways. Indeed, viral and microbial agents have been reported to produce molecular hallmarks of neurodegeneration, such as the production and deposit of misfolded protein aggregates, oxidative stress, deficient autophagic processes, synaptopathies and neuronal death.

The largest decline in HSV-1 seroprevalence from 1999–2004 to 2005–2010 was observed among adolescents aged 14–19 years, among whom seroprevalence declined by nearly 23\%, from 39.0\% to 30.1\% (P \&lt; .01). In this age group, HSV-1 seroprevalence declined \&gt;29\% from 1976–1980 to 2005–2010 (P \&lt; .01).Conclusions. An increasing number of adolescents lack HSV-1 antibodies at sexual debut. In the absence of declines in HSV-2 infections, the prevalence of genital herpes may increase.},
