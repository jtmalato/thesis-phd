The best model for each analysis/comparison is shown in bold. $\text{ME/CFS}_\text{all}$, $\text{ME/CFS}_\text{inf}$ and $\text{ME/CFS}_\text{noinf}$ represent all the ME/CFS patients, ME/CFS patients with an infectious trigger, and ME/CFS patients with a non-infectious trigger, respectively.}

For simplicity, the antibodies were identified by their peptide. Statistically significant findings were obtained for $-\log_{10}(\text{adjusted p-value}) > 1.30$ ($= -\log_{10}(0.05)$) controlling for false discovery rate of 5\% using the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure.}
