    \caption[Percentage of individuals with presence of each symptom, across multiple sclerosis, ME/CFS as a single cohort, and ME/CFS separated into four distinct subgroups]{Percentage of individuals with presence of each symptom, across multiple sclerosis (MS), ME/CFS as a single cohort, and ME/CFS separated into four distinct subgroups. Symptoms marked with an asterisk were removed due to a high percentage of missing values and percentages were not estimated. Differences in sample sizes from Table~\ref{tab:tab1-basic-characteristics-cfs-ms} reflect the removal of some individuals due to a large proportion of missing data across the symptoms.}

    \caption[AUC and its 95\% confidence interval, optimal cutoff and associated sensitivity and specificity to discriminate patients with multiple sclerosis from healthy controls]{AUC and its 95\% confidence interval (CI), optimal cutoff and associated sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) to discriminate patients with multiple sclerosis (cases) from healthy controls. In the Direction column, the symbols ``{>}'' and ``{<}'' represent higher value in MS cases than in healthy controls and vice-versa, respectively. In the Cutoff column, the p-value within brackets came from the Pearsonâ€™s $\chi^2$ test with Yates' correction for $2 \times 2$ tables after being adjusted for a false discovery rate of 5\% using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. In the AUC column, the symbol ``{$\ast$}'' denote the cases where there is evidence of AUC different from 0.50 (random guess).}
