\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption[Basic descriptive characteristics of healthy controls and ME/CFS patients]{Basic descriptive characteristics of healthy controls and ME/CFS patients. Patients were considered to be a single population, two subgroups based on the severity of symptoms (mild to moderate or severely affected), or four subgroups according to the responses about infection triggers given in the symptoms' assessment questionnaire (S0, S1, S2, or S3). P-values refer to Pearson's Chi-squared test for qualitative measures and the two-sided Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test on the quantitative medians. HC, Healthy control; S0, Do not know; S1, Non-infection trigger; S2, Infection trigger but not confirmed with a lab test; S3, Infection trigger confirmed with a lab test; SD, Standard deviation; Min, Minimum; Max, Maximum.}

Symptoms marked with an asterisk were removed from the analysis due to the percentage of missing values across all patients surpassing 20\% (see Figure~\ref{fig:figa1-ordinal-symptom-proportion-by-absent}).}

    \caption[Samples sizes of the 241 ME/CFS patients in each BIC-based latent class estimated on each domain]{Samples sizes (and rounded percentages, row-wise) of the 241 ME/CFS patients in each latent class estimated on each domain. For each domain, the latent classes are arranged by increasing level according to the severity profile from the response probabilities (Supplementary Figure~\ref{appendix:figa3-lca-response-probabilities-bic-absent}). Each domain is independent. The optimal number of classes on each domain was chosen based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). P-values refer to Pearson's $\chi^2$ test.}

Symptoms are ordered by decreasing level of severity and relative proportion. Vertical dashed line at the 0.2 mark designates the missing values cutoff. Symptoms with a proportion of unreported (missing) severity across all individuals higher than that value were identified (relative proportions that surpass the cutoff are indicated in the missing columns) and removed from the analysis. A more detailed description of each symptom can be found elsewhere (Supplementary Table~\ref{appendix:taba2-sym-description}).}
