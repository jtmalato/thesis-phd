Given the absence of a disease-specific biomarker, there are more than 20 symptoms-based case definitions of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. As a consequence, the diagnosis for a given patient could vary from one case definition to another. In this context, we analyse data from a biobank dedicated to this disease in order to study the agreement between different case definitions, the similarity between symptom's profile among all participants including healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis. We also investigate the impact of patients' misclassification on a hypothetical association analysis using data simulation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease whose patients manifest unexplained fatigue lasting for more than six months \citep{fukuda1994ChronicFatigue} or suffer from post-exertional malaise that is not alleviated by rest \citep{carruthers2003MyalgicEncephalomyelitis}. Disease prevalence has been estimated between 0.4\% and 1.0\% affecting six women to one man \citep{morrisMyalgicEncephalomyelitisChronic2013}. The underlying pathological mechanisms remain poorly understood, but they are often associated with environmental stressors, including severe viral infections \citep{rasa2018ChronicViral}. 

Until now there is no accurate biomarker for disease diagnosis. To overcome this problem, researchers and clinicians altogether have proposed more than 20 different case definitions based on patients' symptomatology while excluding known diseases that could explain the fatigue reported by suspected cases \citep{brurberg2014CaseDefinitions}. As a consequence, the diagnosis for a given patient can vary from one case definition to another. Therefore, research from ME/CFS could be affected by the inclusion of false positive cases in the respective data. 

In the present paper, we discuss the problem of diagnosing ME/CFS using data from the United Kingdom ME/CFS Biobank (UKMEB). With this purpose, we first introduce the biobank and its data. We then assess the agreement between 4 common case definitions of ME/CFS in 275 suspected cases belonging to the UKMEB. We then estimate the similarity between symptom's severity profiles from suspected cases, patients with multiple sclerosis, and healthy controls. We also study the impact of patients' misclassification on the statistical power of a hypothetical association analysis. Finally, we conclude this paper with some final remarks.

\section{The UKMEB}

The UKMEB refers to a large data set of suspected cases of ME/CFS, healthy controls, and patients with multiple sclerosis included as an additional control group \citep{lacerda2018UKME}. In terms of recruitment, suspected cases were identified in different institutions across the National Health Service from the United Kingdom and then referred to the CureMe group, a dedicated clinical research team based in the London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine and responsible for recruiting, managing, and curating the biobank. For this paper, the data set under analysis consists of a total of 523 participants divided into 275 suspected cases of ME/CFS, 136 healthy controls, and 112 patients with multiple sclerosis.

\section{Diagnostic agreement analysis}
\label{sec:diagnostic-agreement-analysis}

After patients' referral for a possible integration in the biobank, suspected cases were comprehensively evaluated according to four case definitions of ME/CFS: Centre for Disease Control criteria (CDC-1994) \citep{fukuda1994ChronicFatigue}, Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC-2003) \citep{carruthers2003MyalgicEncephalomyelitis}, Institute of Medicine Criteria (IOM-2015) \citep{instituteofmedicine2015MyalgicEncephalomyelitis}, and International Consensus Criteria (ICC-2011) \citep{carruthers2011MyalgicEncephalomyelitis}. The CDC-1994 requires the patients to have unexplained fatigue for at least 6 months and at least four out of eight fatigue-related symptoms. The IOM-2015 is typically used by general practitioners and it requires the patients to show at least three main symptoms such as profound fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and unrefreshing sleep. The CCC-2003 requires the patients to manifest four or more fatigue specific symptoms, at least two neurological or cognitive ones, and at least one autoimmune, neuroendocrine, or immune symptom. Finally, the ICC-2011 is more focused on neuro-immune and cognitive symptoms, and on the inability to produce sufficient energy on demand (post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion). 

There were 269 (97.8\%), 233 (84.7\%), 229 (83.3\%) and 213 (77.5\%) out of 275 suspected cases whose symptoms agreed with CDC-1994, IOM-2015, CCC-2003, and ICC-2011, respectively (Table~\ref{tab:freq-cases-by-criteria}). This finding suggests that the general practitioners who referred the suspected cases to a possible integration in the biobank made their diagnosis based on the CDC-1994. Unsurprisingly, only 62.9\% of the suspected cases ($n=173$) had a positive diagnosis across all the four case definitions. Therefore, the remaining suspected cases had at least one negative diagnosis.

    \label{tab:freq-cases-by-criteria}
\end{table}
% Table 1
% Table~\ref{tab:freq-cases-by-criteria}

It is worth noting that there were no suspected cases who had a negative diagnosis across all case definitions. There were also three individuals whose symptoms agreed with ICC-2011 only, IOM-2015 only, or both criteria. These individuals were considered to be fatigued but non-ME/CFS patients given that they did not agree with either the CDC-1994 or the CCC-2003 as  recommended for ME/CFS research \citep{pheby2020DevelopmentConsistent}.

To better understand the agreement between diagnostic outcomes obtained from different case definitions, we used the Jaccard's similarity index, $J$ \citep{gowerSimilarityDissimilarityDistance2014}. Note that this index is usually a measure used to compare objects with shared attributes. Here we instead applied this index to compare attributes themselves. For a pair of case definitions $(C_i, C_j)$, this index was estimated as
%this index varies between 0 and 1 ($0 \leq J(C_i, C_j) \leq 1$)
% 
\begin{equation}
    J(C_i, C_j) = \frac{S}{S_i + S_j - S}, \	i, j = 1, \dotsc, 4 \	,
    \label{eq:jaccard-index}
\end{equation}
% Equation (1)
% Equation~(\ref{eq:jaccard-index})
% 
where $S_i$ and $S_j$ are the number of suspected cases with a positive diagnosis by $C_i$ and $C_j$, respectively, and $S$ is the number of suspected cases with a positive diagnosis by both criteria. In theory, the index is defined between 0 and 1 (i.e., no and full agreement between $C_i$ and $C_j$ across all individuals, respectively). 

The estimates of this index ranged from 0.752 (IOM-2015 versus ICC-2011) to 0.876 (CDC-1994 versus IOM-2015; CDC-1994 versus CCC-2003) (Table~\ref{tab:jaccard-similarity-index}). The estimates showed the stringency and differences in scope of each case definition. In addition, these estimates showed that, even if the general practitioners applied two different case definitions of ME/CFS in their diagnosis, there could still be a fraction of suspected cases where the respective diagnostic outcomes might not agree with each other.

\section{Symptoms' similarity analysis}

A major advantage of using data from the UKMEB is the comprehensive symptom's characterisation of all study participants. In particular, each participant  had to report the severity of 57  symptoms occurred a month before data collection. Severity of each symptom was categorised into absence, mild, moderate, and severe. These invaluable data were then analysed to assess the similarity of all participants in terms of their symptom's severity profile. With this purpose, we first computed all possible $4 \times 4$ contingency tables resulting from cross-tabulating the symptom's severity data for any given pair of participants $(i, j)$, $i, j = 1, \dotsc, 523$. We then calculated a similarity matrix between any given pair of individuals by estimating the Cohen's $\kappa$ coefficient \citep{agresti2011CategoricalData} in the corresponding $4 \times 4$ contingency tables, that is,
% 
\begin{equation}
    \kappa_{ij} = \frac{\sum^4_{k=1}{p_{ij,kk}} - \sum^4_{k=1}{p_{ij,k\cdot} p_{ij,\cdot k}}}{1-\sum_{k=1}^4{p_{ij,k\cdot}p_{ij,\cdot k}}}\ ,
    \label{eq:cohens-kappa-coef}
\end{equation}
% Equation (2)
% Equation~(\ref{eq:cohens-kappa-coef})
% 
where $k = 1, \dotsc, 4$ , $p_{ij,kk}$ is the proportion of symptoms with severity $k$ reported by both individuals $i$ and $j$, $p_{ij,k\cdot} $ is the proportion of symptoms with severity $k$ reported by individual $i$, and $p_{ij,\cdot k} $ is the proportion of symptoms with severity $k$ reported by individual $j$. The resulting similarity matrix was then analysed by classical multidimensional scaling (MDS; Figure~\ref{fig:cohens-mds-and-dendrogram}A) and hierarchical cluster analysis using complete linkage (Figure~\ref{fig:cohens-mds-and-dendrogram}B).

With respect to the classical MDS, the first two components could explain 33.1\% of the total inertia (Figure~\ref{fig:cohens-mds-and-dendrogram}A). More importantly, the first component clearly discriminated healthy controls from suspected cases of ME/CFS. In the same component, patients with multiple sclerosis and the three fatigued non-ME/CFS cases  were located between these two groups with some overlap. As expected, healthy participants were the most homogeneous cohort due to an absence or, at most, mild severity of the different symptoms. In contrast, the suspected cases of ME/CFS consisted of a diverse group as evidenced by their wide spread in the plot. Interestingly, a few suspected cases of ME/CFS had symptom's severity profiles similar to the ones from healthy controls. In agreement with these observations, the hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that some suspected cases of ME/CFS could be placed in clusters together with healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (Figure~\ref{fig:cohens-mds-and-dendrogram}B); a detailed analysis on the optimal number of clusters will be done elsewhere. Therefore, it was reasonable to assume that some of the suspected cases of ME/CFS, although agreeing with CDC-1994 or CCC-2003, could be in fact true cases of another disease, as discussed \citet{nacul2019HowHave}.

\section{Impact of misclassification on an association analysis}

Given the possibility of patients' misclassification, we performed a small simulation study to assess the reduction of statistical power attributed to this issue in the context of an association analysis. With this purpose, we simulated data from a case-control study with the aim to investigate a hypothetical association of a binary exposure variable (exposed versus not exposed) with ME/CFS. In this scenario, the observable data could be summarised by a $2 \times 2$ frequency table whose sampling distribution was given by the following product of two Binomial distributions,
% 
\begin{equation}
    f \left( x_0, x_1 | n_0, n_1; \theta_0, \theta_1 \right) = \prod_{i=0,1} \binom{n_i}{x_i} \  \theta_i^{x_i} (1 - \theta_i)^{n_i - x_i} \ ,
    \label{eq:augmented-version-2-by-2}
\end{equation}
% Equation (3)
% Equation~(\ref{eq:augmented-version-2-by-2})
% 
where $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ are the frequencies of exposed healthy controls and suspected cases, respectively, $n_0$ and $n_1$ are the associated sample sizes, and $\theta_{0}$ and $\theta_{1}$ are the corresponding probabilities of exposure in healthy controls and suspected cases. %Pearson's $\chi^2$ test for testing independence in a two-way contingency could be used to test whether healthy controls and suspected cases have the same probability of exposure. Alternatively, the Fisher's exact test could also be applied. In both tests, suspected cases are assumed to have been diagnosed correctly.

To study the impact of a potential misclassification of suspected cases on the detection of a possible association, four main assumptions were considered for the simulated data: (i) suspected cases could be divided into apparent (or false positive) cases and true positive cases of ME/CFS; (ii) the apparent cases were deemed equivalent to healthy controls in terms of degree of exposure, i.e., the probability of exposure in these individuals was given by $\theta_0$; (iii) there was an overall misclassification rate, $\gamma$, for the suspected cases; and (iv) misclassification was only dependent on the true clinical status of each suspected case. 
%According to the total probability theorem, the probability of exposure in suspected cases can be redefined as 
%\begin{equation}
%\theta_{1} = \gamma \theta^+_1 + (1-\gamma) \theta^*_1 \ ,
%\end{equation} 
%where $\theta^+_1$ and $\theta^*_1$ are the probabilities of exposed apparent and true cases, respectively. According to assumption (ii), $\theta^+_1 \equiv \theta_0$, therefore,
%\begin{equation}
%\theta_{1} = \gamma \theta_0 + (1-\gamma) \theta^*_1 \	.
%\end{equation}  
Under the assumption (ii) and the law of total probability, the probability of exposure associated with suspected cases could be written as 
% 
\begin{equation}
    \theta_{1} = \gamma \theta_0 + (1-\gamma) \theta^*_1 \	,
\end{equation}
% 
where $\theta^*_1$ is the probability of exposed true cases.

We then studied the power of rejecting the null hypothesis of lack of association (i.e., $H_0\text{: odds ratio} = 1$) by the Pearson's $\chi^2$ test for independence, when considering this simple misclassification scenario. Similar investigation could have been done using Fisher's exact test instead. With this purpose, we used simulation to estimate the number of times that $H_0$ could be rejected at a significance level of 5\%. 

We augmented the observable $2\times 2$ frequency table where the suspected cases were subdivided into apparent and true positive cases (Table~\ref{tab:augmented-2-by-2}). In this case, we simulated data from healthy controls according to the Binomial distribution with a sample size of $n_0$ individuals and probability of success $\theta_0$. With respect to the suspected cases, we simulated data from a Multinomial distribution with a sample size of $n_1$ individuals and probability vector given by the probabilities shown in Table~\ref{tab:augmented-2-by-2}. Note that, given assumption (iv), the associated Multinomial  distribution could be decomposed into the following Binomial distribution
% 
\begin{equation}
    n_{1,m} | n_1; \gamma \leadsto Bin (n_1, \gamma) \ ,
\end{equation}
% 
referring to how many individuals were hypothetically misclassified as true positive cases, and two Binomial distributions conditional to $n_{1,m}$
% 
\begin{equation}
    X_{1,F} | n_{1,m}; \theta_0 \leadsto Bin (n_{1,m}, \theta_0) \ ,
\end{equation}
% 
and 
% 
\begin{equation}
    X_{1,T} | n_1-n_{1,m}; \theta^*_1 \leadsto Bin (n_1-n_{1,m}, \theta^*_1) \ ,
\end{equation}
% 
where $X_{1,F}$ and $X_{1,T}$ were the random variables referring to the number of exposed false positive and true positive cases, respectively.

\begin{table}[h]

    \label{tab:augmented-2-by-2}
    %\vspace{-4mm}
\end{table}
% Table 3
% Table~\ref{tab:augmented-2-by-2}

For illustrative purposes, we performed our simulation study with $n_0 = n_1 = 100$, $\theta_0=0.25$, and $\theta^*_1=0.35$. According to this parameter specification, the odds ratio of true positive cases versus healthy controls was 1.62, a low but reasonable value for a putative association with ME/CFS, given that there is no disease-specific biomarker. To estimate the power of rejecting $H_0$, we generated 10,000 data sets for each value of $\gamma$, ranging from 0 (no misclassification) to 1 (full misclassification) with a lag of 0.01. In each data set, $H_0$ was rejected if the p-value of the Pearson's $\chi^2$ test was less than 0.05. For a given parameter set, power was finally estimated as the proportion of simulated data sets in which $H_0$ was rejected. 

As expected, the estimated power decreased with the misclassification rate  $\gamma$ (Figure~\ref{fig:misclassiification-rates}). As a control scenario, when all suspected cases were considered to be false positives ($\gamma = 1$) and therefore the data sets were simulated from $H_0$, the corresponding power was estimated at 5\%, the significance level specified for the Pearson's $\chi^2$ test. In opposition, when the suspected cases were all considered true positive cases ($\gamma=0$), the power to detect a hypothetical association was estimated at 34\%. This low power simply reflected the limited sample size to detect a weak association between exposure and the disease. In a less extreme case of misclassification, $\gamma=10\%$ implied an estimated power of 29\%, which reflected a decrease in 14.7\% of the power estimated for the scenario with no misclassification.

\section{Concluding remarks}

In summary, our analysis showed that suspected cases of ME/CFS from the UKMEB did not fully agree with four main case definitions of the disease. In addition, some of these suspected cases showed symptom's severity profiles similar to healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis. These findings demonstrated the difficulty of diagnosing ME/CFS based on symptoms' assessment alone. To overcome this and other difficulties, there are currently efforts for a stronger collaboration among European researchers for accelerating the discovery of an objective disease-specific biomarker \citep{scheibenbogen2017EuropeanME}. However, joint efforts for biomarker discovery are very likely to suffer from limited statistical power due to a possible misclassification of the suspected cases. A possible solution to this problem is to take into account for misclassification in the respective statistical analysis. Such a solution is also problematic because modelling misclassification leads to an eventual problem of overparameterisation. From a frequentist standpoint, overparameterization could be avoided by fixing the misclassification rate in a reasonable estimate for the sensitivity of the diagnostic test. A more elegant way of doing so is to use Bayesian analysis where the prior information about the misclassification rate takes the form of a probability distribution. However, both frequentist and Bayesian solutions show a main hurdle for their implementation in the research of ME/CFS. Given the lack of a disease biomarker, it is unclear which reasonable value or probability distribution to choose for the sensitivity of current diagnostic tools of ME/CFS. 

As a final remark, our formulation of the misclassification problem assumed that misclassification is only dependent on the true clinical status of the suspected cases. In practice, it is very likely that misclassification is dependent on the symptoms' severity profile of a given individual, or at least dependent on a given set of covariates. If so, \citet{paulinoBinomialRegressionMisclassification2003} provided a Bayesian solution for modelling misclassification in this scenario. Given its technical complexity, we envision some difficulties in a wide application of this statistical solution by researchers of ME/CFS who are typically not trained in such advanced statistical methodology. To overcome this potential problem, we recommend a strong collaboration between these researchers and biostatisticians who have in principle the technical skills needed. %In this way, we produce statistical analyses with the same complexity of the data on suspected cases of ME/CFS.
