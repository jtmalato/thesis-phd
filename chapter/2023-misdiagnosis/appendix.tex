\section{Supplementary equations}

We constructed our analysis considering a classical epidemiological scenario where for a single putative risk factor, individuals can be divided into exposed versus non-exposed. This result can be summarised by a $2 \times 2$ contingency table, whose sampling distribution is the product of two independent Binomial distributions, one Binomial distribution per group,
% 
\begin{equation}
    f(x_i | n_i; \theta_i) = \prod_{i = 0,1} \binom{n_i}{x_i} \theta_{i}^{x_i} (1-\theta_i)^{n_i - x_i}\ ,

\end{equation}

where $x_0$ and $x_1$ are the observed frequencies of healthy controls and suspected cases with presence of the candidate causal factor, respectively, $n_0$ and $n_1$ are the corresponding sample sizes of each group, and $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ are the probabilities for the presence of the candidate causal factor in healthy controls and suspected cases, respectively.
